information blackwater usa founder retired navy seal erik prince \\nprince claimed he had insider knowledge of the investigation that could help explain why fbi director james comey had to announce he was reopening the investigation into clintons email server last week \\nbecause of weinergate and the sexting scandal the nypd started investigating it through a subpoena through a warrant they searched his laptop and sure enough found those  emails they found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing prince claimed \\nthey found state department emails they found a lot of other really damning criminal information including money laundering including the fact that hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile jeffrey epstein bill clinton went there more than  times hillary clinton went there at least six times he said \\nthe amount of garbage that they found in these emails of criminal activity by hillary by her immediate circle and even by other democratic members of congress was so disgusting they gave it to the fbi and they said were going to go public with this if you dont reopen the investigation and you dont do the right thing with timely indictments prince explained \\ni believe  i know and this is from a very wellplaced source of mine at pp one police plaza in new york  the nypd wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation and theyve gotten huge pushback to the point of coercion from the justice department with the justice department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of eric garner almost two years ago thats the level of pushback the obama justice department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters prince said \\ntheres five different parts of the fbi conducting investigations into these things with constant downdrafts from the obama justice department so in the i hope unlikely and very unfortunate event that hillary clinton is elected president we will have a constitutional crisis that we have not seen since i believe  prince declared \\nmarlow asked prince to clarify these revelations \\nnypd was the first one to look at that laptop prince elaborated weiner and huma abedin his wife  the closest adviser of hillary clinton for  years  have both flipped they are cooperating with the government they both have  they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes for huma abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the state department server and from hillary clintons own homebrew server which contained classified information weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found \\nso nypd first gets that computer they see how disgusting it is they keep a copy of everything and they pass a copy on to the fbi which finally pushes the fbi off their chairs making comey reopen that investigation which was indicated in the letter last week the point being nypd has all the information and they will pursue justice within their rights if the fbi doesnt prince contended \\nthere is all kinds of criminal culpability through all the emails theyve seen of that  including money laundering underage sex payforplay and of course plenty of proof of inappropriate handling sendingreceiving of classified information up to sap level special access programs he stated \\nso the plot thickens nypd was pushing because as an article quoted one of the chiefs  thats the level just below commissioner  he said as a parent as a father with daughters he could not let that level of evil continue prince said \\nhe noted that the fbi can investigate these matters but they cant convene a grand jury they cant file charges \\nthe prosecutors the justice department has to do that he explained now as i understand it preet bharara the manhattan prosecutor has gotten ahold of some of this from what i hear hes a standup guy and hopefully he does the right thing \\nmarlow agreed that bhararas sterling reputation as a determined prosecutor was bad news for the clintons \\nprince agreed but said if people are willing to bend or break the law and dont really care about the constitution or due process  if youre willing to use stalinist tactics against someone  who knows what level of pressure could be brought to bear against even the most tenacious law enforcement officials \\nlisten to interview here \\nthe point being fortunately its not just the fbi there are five different offices that are in the hunt for justice but the nypd has it as well prince said citing the wall street journal reporting that has exposed downdraft back pressure from the justice department against both the fbi and nypd in an effort to keep the sunlight and the

\\npolitical bombshell clinton campaign manager robby mook had close ties to disgraced dnc consultant robert creamer image source lockerdome  \\ncreamer gained national attention when he became the subject of video sting operation captured by the investigative nonprofit project veritas  not only was it revealed that the creamer discussed ways to commit voter fraud and violence at donald trump

officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics  potentially giving the clinton campaign and the dnc plausible deniability \\nthe mook fallout is the latest in a laundry list of problems for the clinton campaign and comes at a time when interim dnc chair donna brazile  is embroiled in controversy of over leaked debate questions prior to at least two  town hall debates brazile stepped down from her role at cnn earlier in october heres a passage from the daily caller describing the scenario \\ndonna brazile the interim chair of the democratic national committee began providing town hall and debate questions to the clinton campaign earlier than previously known emails released by wikileaks on monday show \\nthe article continued by stating

developments \\nthe latest development began in early october when new yorkbased fbi officials notified andrew mccabe of the terry mcauliffe campaign contribution scandal the bureaus secondincommand

among agencies was compounded when attorney general loretta lynch and deputy attorney general sally yates objected to fbi director james comey reopening the clinton email server case this past week

hillary clinton campaign are now married to the idea that putin is hacking the us elections in response the president is weighing his options  tougher economic sanctions revoking diplomatic status to russian envoys in the us or even deploying his newly developed malicious cyberactivity tools \\neven vp joe biden wants in on the action threatening moscow by sayingwere sending a message we have the capacity to do it \\nit seems that where ever you turn nowadays someone in washington is issuing a threat against russia are usrussian relations really that bad or does this trend have more to do with the defense industry and power struggles within the us \\nwhat was previously a stance reserved for rightwing neoconservative hawks and cold war holdouts has now infected americas leftwing and is a firm plank in the democratic party platform as evidenced by hillary clintons constant antirussian rhetoric throughout this  election cycle along with the white house clinton has now transformed the democrats into the vanguard of washingtons new antirussia movement \\non july th josh rogin from the washington post wrote the clinton campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on russia after trump suggested wednesday that if russia had indeed hacked clintons private email server it should release the emails the clinton campaign sent out its democratic surrogates to bash russia and trump in a manner traditionally reserved for republicans \\nanyone who was paying attention back then knew this russian hack talking point was purely political but then again whos really paying attention these days certainly not the us media \\nyou can trace the genesis of the democratic partys hardcore antirussian strategy back to when president vladimir putin made a mild passing remark about donald trumps gop primary success from that point on trumps political opponents saw this as an open target in their words comparing one dictator to another \\nnever one to pass up an opportunity to score cheap political points president obama got in on the act intensifying the trumpputin narrative to the level of bromance  if youve made a career out of idealizing ronald reagan then where were you when your own partys nominee for president was kissing up to vladimir putin said obama on oct th at a clinton rally in miami \\nbacked by the obama white house clinton and the media felt they had a green light to keep pressing ahead with blaming russia  not only for the controversial dnc leaks but also for hacking into us election systems in arizona  a charge devoid of any evidence other than innuendo and speculation the medias coverage on this issue was deceptive from the onset in a leading news release entitled  russian hackers targeted arizona election system  we can see how after the cocksure headline the first paragraph would always sound definitive \\nhackers targeted voter registration systems in illinois and arizona and the fbi alerted arizona officials in june that russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state \\nbut then by the time you advanced down the story the report would quickly retreat into a zone of uncertainty \\nthe bureau described the threat as credible and significant an eight on a scale of one to  matt roberts a spokesman for arizona secretary of state michele reagan r said monday as a result reagan shut down the states voter registration system for nearly a week \\nand then down to almost nothing \\nit turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system they had however stolen the username and password of a single election official in gila county \\nat no point was any evidence ever given only ambiguous statements like cyber security officials agree that this looks very much like a russian governmentdirected hack \\nare american politicians so callous as to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to further their shortterm political ambitions better yet has american political life really arrived in such a dark cul de sac translated in french bottom of the bag where politicians in power are so insecure as to makeup and propagate wild international conspiracy theories  in the middle a national election cycle its a very depressing prospect and yet this is exactly what we are seeing in this  presidential election \\nbehind clintons wild hyperbolic rants about the kremlin and wikileaks you will find the white house \\non october th the obama administration formally accused the russian government of stealing emails from the democratic national committee and other highprofile individuals including hillary clintons campaign manager john podesta  giving them to wikileaks \\nsoon there was a queue of national security politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon senator ben sasse ner a member of the homeland security committee spouted out russia must face serious consequences moscow orchestrated these hacks because russian president vladimir putin believes sovietstyle aggression is worth it the united states must upend putins calculus with a strong diplomatic political cyber and economic response \\naccording to a washington post report by technology editor ellen nakashima  the only evidence that seems to be available on this story is a corporate analysis of the alleged russian government hacks provided by a us cyber security company called crowdstrike  no actual specifics are given so we are meant to take private firm crowdstrikes word for it \\nimage crowdstrike cyber security \\nthe posts nakashima then added \\nthe administration also blamed moscow for the hack of the democratic congressional campaign committee and the subsequent leak of private email addresses and cellphone numbers of democratic lawmakers \\nan online persona calling himself guccifer  has claimed responsibility for posting the material those sites and that persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of russiandirected efforts the joint statement said  we believe based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts that only russias seniormost officials could have authorized these activities \\nmoscows press secretarys reply this is some sort of nonsense said dmitry peskov \\ndespite the constant repetition by democrat media surrogates and as cnns maria cardona said last night no us national intelligence agency has really confirmed that russia was behind the email hacks  and still no evidence  other than speculative guesswork has been presented \\nlikewise us intelligence agencies have never actually said definitively on record that russia did it thus leaving the door open to walkback the accusation at a later date standard washington procedure of ambiguity this little detail doesnt seem to matter in this hyperbolic political climate though it seems that the white house hillary clinton and media operatives like cardona  are quite happy living in what john kerry recent dubbed as a  parallel universe  \\nstill during the final presidential debate hillary clinton proudly crowed how   us intelligence agencies  aka the intelligence community all agreed that russia did it \\nthe announcement albeit vague actually originated from the office of the director of national intelligence \\nwe have  intelligence agencies civilian and military who have all concluded that these espionage attacks these cyberattacks come from the highest levels of the kremlin and they are designed to influence our election said clinton i find that deeply disturbing \\nwhats even more disturbing is the fact that clinton is lying in front of a national audience the highest levels of the kremlin here are clintons  agencies \\nair force intelligence army intelligence central intelligence agency coast guard intelligence defense intelligence agency energy department homeland security department state department treasury department drug enforcement administration federal bureau of investigation marine corps intelligence national geospatial intelligence agency national reconnaissance office national security agency navy intelligence and the office of the director of national intelligence \\nwhat does the coast guard intelligence national geospatial intelligence agency or the drug enforcement administration know about john podestas emails answer nothing \\nthe exact same thing happened following wikileaks first trove of dnc emails back in july   the us government issued a vague accusatory statement but would not actually name the culprit some might call that propaganda \\nin both instances the obama administration refused to present any evidence translated there was no evidence if there had been the white house would have been shouting from the rooftops and using it as leverage to apply muscle in the un over washingtons flagging efforts in syria both obama administration announcements were nothing more than dog whistles for democrats and journalists working for hopelessly partisan outlets like new york times and cnn  none of whom have bothered to press the white house for one ounce of evidence pertaining to the partys decree that russian is hacking the us election process if you actually look at the joint dnidhs statement issued on the matter it contains no definitive statement  the hacks are consistent with the methods and motivations of russiandirected efforts these thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the us election process such activity is not new to moscow  the russians have used similar tactics and techniques across europe and eurasia for example to influence public opinion there we believe based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts that only russias seniormost officials could have authorized these activities according to nsa intelligence workerturned whistleblower william binney  when asked about wikileaks and whether the russians are hacking us elections he concluded that the cyber efforts against the dnc were more likely to be the work of a  disgruntled us intelligence worker  \\nunder partisan pressure from senior democrat senator harry reid  the fbi also initiated another investigation into people linked to the trump team with russia reid was unset about the dnc hacks and the podesta emails and demanded the fbi do something about the trump campaign to date the fbi havent come up with anything \\nto be fair hillary would have every reason to believe that the kremlin is behind the hack  because her staff read it to her from the campaigns daily intelligence briefings presumably supplied from the us governments much vaunted intelligence community  of course thats the same intelligence community that briefed george w bush about saddams nonexistent nuclear weapons program and who also briefed colin powell about iraqs imaginary winnebagos of death aka mobile anthrax labs disguised as senior doublewide camper vans so of course they would know if putin directed the dnc leaks and podesta email hacks \\nfor those us who are skeptical of the great oxymoron known as washington intelligence i can almost hear the mainstream rebuttal now no that was iraq that was bush were not like that no this time its different this time we are sure the russians did it \\nin  obama claimed that kims notorious bureau  hacked into sony pictures \\nthis isnt the first time that president obama has cried wolf on a foreign hack and then tried to sell it for political purposes back in december  obama claimed that north korea had hacked sony pictures in hollywood pentagoncia media proxy cnn quickly chimed in to support washingtons conspiracy theory floating a colorful story that kim jingun had deployed a secret underground hacking unit called  bureau   just like with todays russian hack theory no member of the mainstream press dared to question the white houses ridiculous north korean claim and like the russian hack claims the only source cited for sony hack was analysis provided by us firm crowdstrike  \\njumping the shark \\nafter their democratic party convention on july th the clinton campaign machine put all of its chips on their putin narrative \\nsoon after a cadre of top clinton national security surrogates then accused trump of emboldening russia in their evil plot to destabilize and dominate the west tom donilon a former national security adviser then accused russia of interfering with elections all over europe and then accused trump is helping russia directly at that point they were in too deep to turn back the biggest impact of wikileaks  shining a spotlight on russias attempt to undermine american democracy and trumps refusal to condemn it httpstcoalzpymbb \\n josh schwerin joshschwerin october   \\nclinton spin doctors josh schwerin and michael fallon would stoop even lower by accusing rt of having possession of the podesta emails even before wikileaks did their only evidence seemed to be twitter posts by rt news which clinton held up as proof that the kremlin was frontrunning wikileaks email dumps the clinton braintrust failed to note that the podesta emails were posted on wikileaks own website well before rt news had tweeted about them at that point it became obvious that the clinton campaign was panicking and hysterically grabbing for any excuse they could get their hands on we then watched as one rt reporter after another dismantled the clinton campaigns desperate claims it was embarrassing \\nthey could not face the uncomfortable fact that it was wikileaks head julian assange who chose the timing of the release of the dnc and podesta emails rather than attack assange himself who happens to be popular with millennials the very group clinton struggles to connect with her operatives opted to target russia and trump instead \\neither way the political strategy here is clear  to shoot the messenger  the clinton campaign is stuck in permanent rearguard mode because based on the content of both the dnc leaks wikileaks files and project veritas video  their own democratic party has been discredited and exposed as a corrupt political organization \\ntheir other big problem is that despite all the outrage from democrats and their mainstream media surrogates none of the leaked content has been challenged on the basis of its authenticity the results speak for themselves the initial dnc leak of  emails resulted in the resignation of dnc chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz  they revealed the unthinkable the democratic national committee actively worked to undermine the presidential campaign of bernie sanders in favor of the establishment choice in hillary clinton sanders never had a chance honest commentators called this an affront to the democratic process while party insiders and clinton supporters pretended to be aloof as if it never happened \\nto prove this point both president obama and hillary clinton then gave wassermanschultz a glowing endorsement on the way out for the last eight years chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz has had my back this afternoon i called her to let her know that i am grateful said obama not surprisingly clinton thanked wasserman schultz presumably for helping to knock her only competitor sanders out of the democrat primary race i am grateful to debbie for getting the democratic party to this years historic convention in philadelphia and i know that this weeks events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership said clinton \\nthe party had sold its soul to devil and no one seemed to care too much about it \\nparty meltdown \\nwasserman schultzs replacement didnt fair much better dnc vice chairwoman donna brazile was installed to serve as interim chair through the remainder election but brazile was soon skewered by subsequent wikileaks batches  showing how on more than one occasion she fed debate questions obtained from corrupt mainstream media operatives  straight to hillary clinton \\n a march  email exchange shows brazile stating that she received a town hall question from roland martin a tv one host who comoderated a march  town hall with cnns jake tapper \\n a march  email shows that she shared a question with clinton campaign chairman john podesta and communications director jennifer palmieri that was to be asked in a march  debate hosted by cnn in flint mich source daily caller  \\nbraziles audacious fraud also helped contribute to her partys planned sabotage of democrat challenger bernie sanders watch brazile go into full meltdown when confronted here \\n completely corrupt and still brazile even had to temerity to deny doing it when pressed on fox news last week braziles reputation is so bad now that even cnn has severed ties with her  and thats saying a lot \\nin addition it was also revealed how cnns head political commentator gloria borger  was named by podesta as one of a shortlist of journalists the clinton campaign would work with to gain favorable coverage youd think that cnn would have dropped borger after this was revealed but no amazingly borger is still leading cnns election coverage \\nclearly cnn cannot be trusted to police itself when it comes to matters of outright collusion with hillary clinton and the democratic party everunbiased cnns gloria borger refers to being in gop hell and says shell reach out soon to podesta heartwarming podestaemails pictwittercomcqfdcjq \\n lb hacker owens nubianawakening october   \\nworse than watergate \\nperhaps a bigger scandal which the obama white house and clinton campaign operatives would like to bury  is the fbis investigation into the clinton foundation yesterday the wall street journal confirmed the existence of an internal feud between the fbi and the justice department over whether or not to pursue an investigation into clinton issue \\nsome investigators grew frustrated viewing fbi leadership as uninterested in probing the charity these people said others involved disagreed sharply defending fbi bosses and saying mr mccabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the justice department and fbi agents pursuing the clinton foundation case it isnt unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited but the internal debates about the clinton foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president \\ntheres more it was also revealed last week how jill mccabe the wife of fbi deputy director andrew mccabe  received  in campaign funds in late  for her virginia state senate run this unusually large donation came via a political action committee run by virginia govterry mcauliffe  a clinton foundation board member after the funds were donated andrew mccabe was then put in charge of the clinton email case in normal times this one scandal would be bigger than watergate but these are not normal times  \\nso why is washington going all out to deflect to russia  and coverup the clinton scandals and the wikileaks document dumps one reason is because the clinton email issue goes all the way to the top  to the president himself \\nwhat wire reported on oct st is how president obama lied when first confronted about whether or not he knew about the existence of hillarys unauthorized private server obama told cbs news on march   that he only found out about clintons server the same time everybody else learned it through news reports the presidents lie was confirmed when newly released fbi documents showed that \\nobama used a pseudonym bobamaameritechnet when communicating with thensecretary of state hillary clinton by email and at least one of those emails ended up on clintons private email server \\nso not only did obama lie on national tv but he also broke strict white house security protocols by carelessly exchanging private emails off grid with hillary clinton on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server  maybe to avoid the same scrutiny one would have on a government system who knows why he did it \\nsure hes not the first us president to lie but like richard nixon and bill clinton obama just joined that exclusive liars club  caught out lying to the american people \\non top of this any communications made by the president of the united states are de facto labeled as  born classified  the same goes for any state department communications with other foreign ministers \\ncoverup john podesta and huma abedin on the hillary campaign jet image abc

dinner with one of the highest ranked doj officials the very day after hillary clintons benghazi testimony it was peter kadzik \\noh and if that wasnt good enough kadzik was also podestas lawyer back in  when ken starr was investigating podesta over his role in helping bill clinton internmistress monica lewinsky land a job at the united nations the two were described as best friends fox news

\\nits now become clear that the media is guilty on multiple fronts as more proof has emerged of how they are helping to stoke violence while promoting unfounded fears  and all the while pushing fictional hate crime hoaxes \\ncbs news flagship investigative program  minutes conducted a recorded interview with trump on friday in which he made a direct plea on camera to any possible supporters to stop it in reference to anyone that may have written racist slogans or abusive language in public or at schools in light of the numerous pockets of protests and outbreaks of partisan violence which have racked america since the election results were announced last week it would have been in the public interest to release this powerful appeal by trump but instead mainstream cbs buried it for  days until  minutes was scheduled to air later on sunday evening nationwide if cbs had any credibility remaining this certainly will have finished it off \\nwhen told about alleged reports of a trump supporter who were said to have been harassing latinos and muslims following his presidential win trump told interviewer leslie stahl  i am so saddened to hear that he then added and i say stop it if it helps i will say this  and i will say right to the cameras stop it \\none big thing in this incident that many mainstream media observers did not pick up is that at no time did stahl give any specifics on these alleged abuses by trump supporters against muslims and latinos and even though its obvious that trump was not responsible for directing any alleged abuses  stahl still demanded an apology on their behalf  without offering any evidence to support her claim this was driveby media at its worst in fact not one of these said accusations of abuse have been properly investigated by the media and some may end up actually being mediagenerated rumors or even hoaxes \\nnow its perfectly understandable that trumps victory over the establishments heavily inflated candidate hillary clinton has left many democrats especially millennial collegeaged students upset angry and feeling more than a little delicate due to their bruised collective egos they are not upset that trump won as much as they are upset that they lost the real problem exists far beyond the learned immaturity of americas politically correctobsessed young adults the real danger is that democratic party gutter operatives and their liberal media cohorts are actually staging and fabricating hate crime incidents in order to propagate the idea that the president elect and his supporters are somehow causing many minorities fearful about the future in reality much of this hype is being generated through these same liberal media outlets \\nin fact one muslim female from louisiana has since been forced to

partly funded by leading clinton donor and billionaire george soros  watch this stunning clip \\n here is a video of clip of a white male in chicago  yr old david wilcox who was driving and scraped another vehicle when the two parties stopped at the intersection to exchange insurance information wilcox was greeted by a gang of africanamericans presumably democratic party supporters who began pointing and shouting you voted for donald trump before beating and robbing the man in the middle of the street wilcox was then dragged hundreds of yards as he tried to keep the gang from stealing his car in broad daylight he was treated for multiple wounds at a local hospital \\nfrom reports we learned that at no time before the attack took place did wilcox display any support for donald trump it appears as if they attacked him because he was white so could one call this a case of black on white racism regardless its political intimidation done on the street  which could also be defined as pure political fascism in this instance the violence was partisan and carried out by what could be classed as unofficial democrat foot soldiers  enforcing a type of radical political regime on the

apparently by richard dawkins to explain how human thoughts fit in his evolutionary theology memes are thoughts expressed in image andor phrase which by circulation in public acquire the life and subsistence of their own and are able to infect the consciousness with their messages like viruses meme is inexistent because theres no such thing as thoughts having a biologically based selfsubsistence and ability to procreate like viruses images andor phrases are not living beings save by bad analogy that omits to tell us on what exactly it is based what is that one principle making memes and viruses congenial yet they quite paradoxically exist because analogy apparently works  however no one seems to pose the question why it works \\nwell it works because it is magical \\n\\nchaos magick \\n\\nhere we have an example of magical thinking in the postmodern  in fact posthumanist  vein resting on assumption that what has not evolved in nature can  and should  be created in analogy to imagined process of evolution if artificial construct is in line with principle of evolution it is real or to be more precise it is in accordance with imaginary nature of this principle it is imagined into existence  \\ntherefore meme magick works only insofar it relies upon artificial preferably technological medium for sustenance and on assumption that its recipients identify themselves with their artificial preferably online identities that can indeed be imbibed with memes as they are in themselves artificial and arbitrary constructs \\nthe goal of practitioner of such magic  a far cry from what was traditionally considered to be magic  is to change the world according to his will this is more or less what is known from the seventies of the last century as chaos magick  a postmodern imitation of ancient practice of acting in subhuman and subnatural domain of the world in the past mostly confined to people born with dubious talent to practice it the peculiarity of chaos magick is on the one hand that it is entirely syncretic ie that it uses everything that its practitioner can imbibe with intended subjective meaning and that it relies on virtual ie artificial world of mass culture now embodied above all in internet \\nthe idea behind it all is that nothing is true and everything is possible  \\nthere are many interesting implications to this \\nthe first is that everything is interrelated ie that everything is connected with everything else so any which way you take youll get where you want to get if you will it hard enough the second is that theres no hierarchy of higher and lower  theres only an infinite surface dissolving into ever more complex elements dissolving in turn into nothingness if concentrated upon as theres nothing higher theres nothing to be revered and everything can  and indeed should  be an object of ironical laughter and most importantly this is the world of dreams ruled by what is usually called dream logic but in actual fact chaos logic or unlogic  \\nin this sense richard spencer quite accurately proclaimed trumps victory an accomplishment of meme or chaos magick \\ntrump is willed into office by internet memes binding the will of alt right adherents and turning their dream into reality  virtual reality one may add yet reality nonetheless the fact that trump was elected for a plethora of motives  from the appeal of his politics to public takedown of hillary clinton by wikileaks  is immaterial because in the world of chaos every subjective reality tunnel or interpretation of the world is as real as any other \\nin this sense we can observe new god emperor of usa as a magical creation of internet by the internet and for the internet  today still the internet of interconnected computer nodes but soon probably the internet of things if one is to push spencers remark to its logical extreme we can assert that illustrious donald is the worlds first president of posthuman race an embodiment of ultra progressive dream invoked to reality by professed ultra antiprogressive group \\nso that was lesser weirdness let us proceed now to high weirdness \\n\\n\\nwe owe the reader an answer to a question who the hell is kek \\nwell the reason why spencer mentions him is again a magickal halfjoke kek is interpreted to be an ancient egyptian deity by a number of internet observers and identified with alt right memetic avatar  pepe the frog while i habitually suspend judgment on all things egyptian because ancient egyptian culture is a slippery ground even for experts i consider this interpretation upon closer inspection to be quite valid in the virtual light of chaos logic \\nnamely pepe the cartoon character conceived in  by cartoonist matt furie emerged as a meme from the depths of internet forums more precisely chan subforum pol devoted to political discussions with no holds barred which was in view of some observers a breeding ground for many alt right aficionados a place of absolute freedom therefore absolute chaos \\nthe expression kek was also appropriated from the forums and stems from the injoke among the players of world of warcraft  replacing the standard internet abbreviation lol laughing out loud someone eventually noticed that kek is in fact the name of frogheaded egyptian deity signifying chaos and darkness and pepe was rebranded as kek the deity  ironic one no doubt half joking one as surprisingly many alt righters like to put it but deity nonetheless \\nit is important to point out that in view of the most esoteric kekists that is half grinning faithful of kekpepe the association was originally entirely haphazard and accidental yet it developed into an ever growing system of synchronicities  causally unrelated meaningful relations among events so it came to pass that kek sounds very similar to cuckoriginally cuckservative a term denoting old fashioned conservative who was still not red pilled another meme taken from pop culture shared by both alt right and conspiracy theorists by alt right or should we assume kek himself furthermore hillary clinton addressed pepe as nothing less than public enemy identifying presumably the whole alt right movement with cartoon character then it happened that after this act hillary fainted in front of the cameras and that was immediately interpreted as an action of kek \\na good rundown of kekpepetrump identification \\nhowever it all began with people noticing the numerical synchronicities in the random series of numbers in posts on pol subforum \\none last thing you need to understand about imageboard culture dubs \\nevery post on chan and similar venues comes with an digit numerical stamp this number represents that posts entry position in the entire posting lineage of the imageboard \\nwith the amount of traffic these sites get the last couple digits of this number are essentially a random roll when a poster gets repeated digits its called dubs trips quads and so on \\nsince a poster cant know their post number until after theyve submitted the post its common for people to bet the contents of their message on the occurrence of repeating digits  when that endeavor proves a successful a get has been made and the stroke of luck is celebrated \\nout of this practice a strange phenomenon began to take place on pol discussion threads associated with trump displayed noticeably frequent gets it wasnt long before all of these seemingly random elements discussed so far became irreparably tied together within imageboard culture pepe the frog now pols unofficial mascot donald trump pols overwhelming candidate of choice repeating digit post numbers gets kek used as an expression of delight particular in response to trumps trolling of the establishment as well as in reaction to unlikely gets in general \\nand a god was born  source  \\n\\nsynchronicities related to emergence of kek the god and his merging with trump in the bowels of internet forums early on in the presidential campaign are so numerous and frankly mind boggling that we cannot list them here for the sake of brevity for our purpose it is sufficient to point out that for many alt right aficionados including core leadership kek is the god and trump is his prophet all declared with smug grin and ironical stance yet with all the necessary power of conviction \\nnamely chaos magick relies on laughter or irreverence of its own principles because it is essentially unprincipled fairly in accordance with its postmodern nature it seeks to deconstruct any kind of order to enable its practitioner to impose his own will and change the world  as spencer would put it make his dreams a reality \\ni would go further and add make all reality a dream  because chaos magick and alt right are nothing more but novel forms in the development of virtual ie posthuman  world the idea of adherence and reattachment to tradition that the alt right movement professes is nothing more but simulacrum appealing to people tired of liberal nihilism  in its essence however it is a complete opposite a disintegration of all substantial traditional principles  above all an idea of preexistent hierarchy of being  into nothingness of primordial chaos \\n\\nposthuman traditionalism \\n\\ni already developed this insight regarding the subversive work of alexander dugin who is probably the most consequent subverter of tradition with recognizable public persona acting in our age but now we can see how his affiliates in usa and europe are doing the same thing  with less philosophical subtlety but fueled by much greater raw power namely alt right if we are to judge by what its leadership advocates is ideologically nothing more but project of building the simulated tradition  something richard spencer likes to call political theology  founded on new age filtered aryan myths  racial interpretation of nietzsche and generally crossbred with do your own thing mentality all done in the virtual ether of information technology after all if we are to agree with spencer  half jokingly of course  that god emperor was inaugurated by the act of kek the god then the victory of alt right traditionalists is in fact the victory of technological magic the act of pseudo magus waving the same wand ray kurzweill and his ilk offer to progressive lunatics  \\nin the end therefore we are talking about another victory of posthumanism branded spontaneously or otherwise as traditionalism the obsession of alt right adherents with identity in general and white identity in particular points to a fact that they are unable to realize the simple truth of tradition they supposedly defend they understand identity as something that can be created and not something that must be accepted  observing the plethora of various rather eccentric individuals in its vanguard from macho gay postmodern spartans to adherents to all kinds of exotic  and to a large extent made up  pagan religions one is at the lack to find a common denominator save maybe for quite unchallenged neodarwinist stance especially to be found among game bloggers as chateau heartiste  if someone thinks that he can reattach himself to premodern spiritual history of humankind  actually the only one there is  while at the same time musing about alpha and beta males sexual market signaling and countersignaling professing therefore his proud monkey ancestry and reducing human relations to mental gmo of memes genes and biological analogies he is doing nothing else than unconsciously subverting the very thing he seemingly defends \\nthe allure of alt right lies in its dialectical opposition to political correctness and rampart destruction of moral substance of the west induced by process of globalization yet this is an eristic or to use an excellent neologism invented by one correspondent of mine discordian dialectic the process of infinite division into ever multiplying opposites founded on the principle of chaos it is all done with the crooked half grin a pinch of salt to every smug remark  with irony of the man who knows hes a liar and a cheat but smug humor goes just a short way in the end it morphs into sarcasm and irreverence of what should in fact be revered and subverts the very principles it professes to defend far more effectively than dead serious pc brigade or techno loonies of posthumanist movement could ever hope for \\nwell end with the word of warning to christian adherents of alt right the words have a definite meanings and power theres only one chaos and theres only one bringer of light from chaos  as some kek worshipers already defined the poor frogs main job  and its not the one to be defined as god from god light from light but god from gutter light from darkness a real darkness shining in virtual brightness hope you guess his name \\nso without a pinch of irony i declare be careful who your hail \\n \\nauthor branko mali? is a

pundits  westerners  not russians the reason rts audience ratings are growing is because the version of news and analysis being presented is resonating with international audiences who see rts reports as more accurate and truthful than media monoliths like the bbc cnn and other establishment outlets by spending most of their time effort and budgets crafting propaganda pieces to cover for the plethora of lies and clandestine operations globally the western media are killing off their own relationship with domestic audiences the age of talking down to the public and assuming them as fools is over rt understood this in  when their news network took shape  years later western media moguls are playing catchup albeit in vainsunset for goebbels hamstrung with layers of management and editorial committees infested with intelligence agency operatives and journalists on the payroll of a deep state star chamber that is so tangled in its own web of subterfuge  obsessed with controlling

out on trade with russia when donald trump is sworn in this january the usukeu antirussian axis could disintegrate within a year  so this latest move by brussels could be a lastditch effort to do some

the tens of millions of euros being laundered by eu member states through a pseudo ngo called the  white helmets in syria  these last  years will certainly go down as one of the worst chapters in

following the results of tuesday nights election president obama has signed executive order   which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on december  th  obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day  too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted  equipment failures as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically \\npeople all over the country have been flooding my office with calls telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers obama told reporters many have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the

where there are high numbers of latino and african american voters we must investigate these claims the margin of victory is too close to call and the outcome of this election is too important there is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for trump \\nunder the presidents order the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted and all poll workers who took part in tuesdays election will be subjected to strict background checks this process is expected to take  days in precincts where the department of justice has cause to believe that

could be effectively used with the invention of the world wide web and its rapid spread the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute commercial reasons alone eg

actually interacting \\n\\nassorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used with the invention of the world wide web

after pamela was there to poison him police in an armored vehicle showed up at the embassy and that night the dns server pointed to a different ip address for wikileaks and google updated everything instantly so the transfer was completely seamless from the real wikileaks server to the fake wikileaks server that was at a completely different ip address \\n\\n mr assanges subsequent tweets were noticeably more hostile and attacked his most loyal supporters i reported this repeatedly \\n\\n mr assanges tweets regularly misspelled the names of some of his closest friends whom he has known for decades gavin mcfadyen became mcfayden for example mcfadyen  the director of wikileaks was found dead three days after assange started having mystery problems this is something i made a huge issue of here \\n\\n streams of disinformation were spewed \\n\\n themes supported by mr assange for years were then knocked down or discredited by his subsequent tweets and communications very bad timing with that everyone with a brain noticed this and it lit up the forums and blogs \\n\\n body double rumors have been circulated and documented \\n\\n new strange hitherto unknown moderators of wikileaks have suddenly been installed \\n\\n his deadman switch was activated before the armored vehicle even showed up at the embassy which means assange probably manually triggered it after he figured out he was poisoned much of his stored data and secret website pins were to be released in the event of his untimely death i released both deadman switches here one encrypted and one unencrypted \\n\\nall of this happened right after pamela anderson showed up with a lunch that was no doubt poisoned and the media talked all about how assange was pale and not feeling well when she left and that he said the food pamela brought him was torture good for a laugh in the inside circles to have this go out on the msm no doubt \\n\\nmy take assange was poisoned and then removed from the embassy in an armored vehicle this was clearly visible in a live feed someone set up that night because something was amiss and i saw that and stayed up the entire night for it that is why i so strongly stated that he cant possibly still be at the embassy perhaps he got medical care to save him and is now being waterboarded \\n\\nif the new wikileak releases are real they are not coming from the wikileaks server  only a

our insiders who have specific firsthand knowledge of the hillary clinton email scandal it seems that things are about to heat up we are told that of the  emails lifted from anthony weiners computer  emails are huma abedins and pay to play  including saudis and israelis meaning huma was the one hillary used to communicate with foreign leaders via email for inside information and deals via humas computer \\n\\nit has been established through many avenues but mainly through wikileaks that the clinton foundation was just a farce set up in order to perform paytoplay games with multiple entities including foreign nations paytoplay nations include israel saudi arabia turkey qatar kazakhstan and the ukraine \\nfurthermore we are told by one of our insiders that one email unequivocally confirms isis was created by cia and israeli secret intelligence service  with help from joe lieberman john mccain and lindsey graham an nypd insider said the content they viewed did include state department top secret emails one file was called life insurance a second file was titled  dnc nuclear arsenal  \\n\\na third file im sure hillary definitely does not want released was a file labeled intimate  according to this nypd insider this file contained xrated photos of huma and hillary with a teenager  \\n\\nnypd detectives were sickened by what they saw according to our insider and they had threatened fbi field agents that they would leak this information if the fbi did not step up and take off the kid gloves  at that point  of the fbi agents in nyc were also threatening to leak the information \\n\\nas you can imagine the scandal has the entire obama administration in full panic we are told there are emails that could send loretta lynch to prison  as well as bill and hillary the twitter post below our sources sent us verifying it is all true \\n\\n\\n\\n\\neven more \\n\\nthe following information comes straight from an fbi anonymous source who is the senior analyst who posted on chan in early july of this year \\n\\njim comey learned that some of his own investigators were tipping off both loretta lynch and bill clinton thus making his job impossible \\n\\ncomey sent a letter to congress knowing that ultimately it would expose loretta lynch as a dirty actor and the breadcrumbs would lead directly to obama  the state department is terrified now comey has assembled a small team of  agents whom he has declared the untouchables after the famous federal agent eliot ness \\n\\ncomey has clamped down on all fbi agents and he expects a fullscale war between the fbi and the department of justice doj the white house and the state department he has confirmed and understands that many sitting senators congressmen lobbyists and power players are going to be indicted and prosecuted  one of the main targets of the probe is the clinton foundation and clinton global initiative among the targets under investigation are john podesta huma cheryl mills cnn abc nbc etc \\n\\nas it turns out weiner humas husband had been forwarding humas emails each time she came home and left her computer open huma appears to have been in touch with saudi actors and therefore espionage is strongly suspected \\ncomey and his   untouchables  are now preparing to take down the largest corruption ever witnessed in american history which is what i think must happen if comey is planning to stay part of the fbi he lost so much respect and so much credibility with the first hillary investigation it would take something of this magnitude to allow him to face the public again the pentagon has internal players and outside players they call  creatives  creatives are civilians who tend to be geniuses malcontents extreme hackers or otherwise demonstrate brilliance in

       " 'link hey people i always enjoy your threads though i think you focus too much on a singular belief issue or pattern and then it becomes self affirming for you in your research first this but voices actual voices in your head is always mental illness sorry maybe a stress reaction not to be judgmental happens to the best and such just really not what i am trying to convey here though i believe you are quite intelligent i dont think you are qualified exactly to make that wholesale definitive judgement you even contradict that by referencing dr vinods channeling of the nine in  channeling by definition from dictionarycom means in one sense the practice of professedly entering a meditative or trancelike state in order to convey messages from a spiritual guide surely this process would involve the sensory structure of hearing i dont wish to debate voice to skull tech with you because i dont sense this is really what your thread is about but there have been lawsuits waged and won over such technology being used to harass people who dont test as schizophrenic or any other dsm related diagnosis that would explain auditory hallucinations indicating mental illness now thats not to say that anyone hearing voices is being technologically harassed but saying definitively its always mental illness does a disservice to the search for knowledge and stopping such technology being used on people link to lawsuit psychotronic weaponsspace preservation acthouse resolution bill brain manipulation from a distance last year in october the congressman dennis j kucinich introduced in the american congress a bill obliging the american president to get engaged in the negotiations aimed at the ban of space based weapons in this bill the definition of a weapon system includes any other unacknowledged or as yet undeveloped means inflicting death or injury on or damaging or destroying a person or the biological life bodily health mental health or physical and economic wellbeing of a person through the use of landbased seabased or spacebased systems using radiation electromagnetic psychotronic sonic laser or other energies directed at individual persons or targeted populations or the purpose of information war mood management or mind control of such persons or populations  as in all legislative acts quoted in this article the bill counts with sound light or electromagnetic stimulation of human brain psychotronic weapons remain at least for a layman uninformed of secret military research in the sphere of science fiction since so far none of the published scientific experiments was presented in the way which would allow for its replication that it is feasible to manipulate human behavior with the use of subliminal either sound or visual messages is now generally known this is why in most of the countries the use of such technologies without consent of the user is banned devices using light for the stimulation of the brain show another way how the light flashing in certain frequencies could be used for the manipulation of human psychic life as for the sound a report on the device transmitting a beam of sound waves which can hear only persons at whom the beam of sound waves is targeted appeared last year in the world newspapers the beam is formed by a combination of sound and ultrasound waves which causes that a person targeted by this beam hears the sound inside of his head such a perception could easily convince the human being that it is mentally ill the acts presented in this article suggest that with the development of technology and knowledge of the functioning of human brain new ways of manipulation of human mind keep emerging one of them seems to be the electromagnetic energy though in the open scientific literature only some  experiments were published supporting this assumption  already in  in the ussr after successful testing with military unit in novosibirsk the installation radioson radiosleep was registered with the government committee on the matters of inventions and discoveries of the ussr described as a method of induction of sleep by means of radio waves     dear senatorattorney letter included we seek your offices assistance in initiating hearings and a factfinding congressional inquiry into the government agencies andor private companies that are targeting citizens many citizens are desperate to be freed from the disturbing intrusive and oppressive targeting evidence supports the conclusion that weapons exist that could be used against individuals based on us patent and trademark office filings public releases by agencies and other technologies that indicate the level of technological sophistication the weapons are believed to be based on electromagnetism microwaves sonic waves lasers and other types of directed energy and were characterized as psychotronic in rep dennis kucinichs draft of house resolution  the space preservation act of  furthermore it is undeniable that government agencies have tested citizens without permission in the past for example the cias human experimentation discussed in orlikow v us  fsupp  ddc  secretly administered lysergic acid diethylamide discussed in united states v stanley  us   and military chemical experimentation as discussed in congressional committee report  d congress d session s prt  dec   lastly the sheer numbers of people complaining of being targeted including people with postgraduate degrees and a lifetime of achievements and the similarities in symptoms tend to outweigh a dismissive response based on charges of anecdotal evidence or group paranoia there is a certain risk of sounding too conspiratorial however common denominators such as physical symptoms and medical reports surveillance scenarios harassment techniques and more can be readily established i highly recommend reading in full the details of this lawsuit containing a great deal of verifiable information the military has admitted for some time to having at the least a non lethal lol weapon called active denial but this rabbit hole goes much much deeper having said all that as ive said before in one of your threads i think it wise to consider that its not just one thing or another its many things there could be aliens for instance and then there could be milabs leaving the person with the memory of an alien abduction rather than their being used for human experimentation which is supposed to be against our constitution and most certainly against our human rights and then people can also suffer from temporal lobe seizure like hallucinations but one must also remember that these can most certainly be induced artificially as well in short i think your rabbit hole is only making it to the gopher level regards',\n",

       " 'link years ago i came here for the ufos and after a small amount of time i stopped believing mostly due to nothing being real anymore most stuff is faked at least in my opinion the below is true even if its not as exciting as cgi videos my main reason for posting is about one of the very few times i saw stuff back in summer of july i went on a camping trip to possum kingdom lake in west texas with a friend robert my last trip as a single guy before i got married the following month the trip was a lot of canoeing swimming cliff diving snorkeling and camping out at night beneath the stars no tent just star gazing while we eventually drifted off to sleep nightly robert and i were best friends and also worked together too anyway one really really dark chilly and moonless night about pm or so we had tucked ourselves in our sleeping bags and had a really good spot elevated with no distractions to look at the night sky i had excellent vision then and could see pretty danged good i was  my friend was  he partook of the herb and drank beer daily and i consumed a few beers daily by nightfall we were tuckered out and wanted nothing more than to just go to sleep the heat of the west texas day really took it out of us the campsite was only accessed by boat we used a rental canoe so we paddled our way to this place that was a fairly large and very rugged rocky peninsula with some cliffs being  foot high they seemed a lot taller to me we camped on the top of the cliffs at night and played down on the water by day so this one night i was looking at a particular spot up there above us and he was looking at another i then saw it and said look right there he having binoculars he looked at where i had pointed saw it and got pretty excited he finally let me look at it through his binoculars and what i saw was the following slightly larger than what we normally see a satellite was a transparent or semitransparent and faint bluish looking sphere a clear bubble really moving at a speed i remember as being slightly faster than what a satellite would be going but not so much faster or slower than any planejet traffic would be in my estimation it was going south and we watched it by passing the binoculars back and forth we both assumed it was a satellite exciting stuff but then one of us i really cant remember who noticed another one this time coming from the east they appeared to be on a course that appeared to us that would be really a close call if they were at the same altitude when they were getting a little too close for comfort at least for us the one that came from the east shot a light bluish light at the southbound sphere it wasnt laserlike at all i dont think but it appeared more like a vshaped beam from a flashlight shot at it it lasted all of a second and i am positive that it happened due to we both saw it at the same time the light flash made the southbound one turn westward now going almost the same direction as the one from the east making them both going in the same direction actually the one that got flashed didnt make a  degree turn it was really going more of a path more like westsouthwest more like  degrees or so just guessing now when i say that it turned it turned abruptly not at all anything like any plane would do that struck us both as being odd no curving involved at all we watched them until they both grew dim from the distance both staying in a straight line to their intended destination of course we kept thinking that the one that flashed the beam would turn and follow the other but nope i could be wrong on the speed and the directions but the rest is completely accurate the really sharp turn back then was unheard of we hear it all of the time now years ago though it wasnt talked about at all not even in the tabloids this is why this really stood out out to me all of these years that almost  degree turn to be honest i just didnt understand what we had just seen we finally got to sleep that night i dont know how long it took us but we did but after a few hours around ish am robert woke me up and said listen and i heard footsteps that scared us pretty good cause we had gotten so worked up earlier i guess heheh we listened to the small branches and small gravel rocks moving beneath whatever it was that was about to kill us well we did until we finally scared ourselves to sleep i have to admit ok yeah i did partake myself but only a little bit i wasnt into it like him but i was on vacation that made us both very paranoid i guess anyway the next morning we found our bread and peanut butter missing the breads plastic wrapper was there but no bread creepy a few years later my boss who i had told all of this to and he made fun of me told me that the same thing happened to him his peanut butter and bread went missing while camped on a river they determined that it was a raccoon which they do this sort of thing i know now now to regular people that might not seem like much especially now days here on this forum more spectacular claims are made daily still for back then it was really something my older brother by  years and i were camping with no tent underneath the starry sky of caddo lake in east texas around  in the spring may i think and we were looking at a patch of sky surrounded by silhouetted trees actually talking about when we were kids looking for flying saucers thats all they were known as back then our entire family would look out at the sky in our backyard it was a common thing for us to do back in the fifties after all that was its heyday as we stared at the sky in the back of my pickup i mentioned the bluish sphere that i had seen years before at possum kingdom lake he being quiet through the entire story he wasnt that talkative really and within  minutes of me mentioning this to him we saw one i had my own binoculars this time i was really amazed it was exactly as what i had seen before i mean exactly nothing major happened though it just quietly slid across the sky in front of us and disappeared behind the trees to our right and that was that my brother was never a believer anyway maybe had it landed it would change his mind we saw several regular ol satellites afterwards too why i even bring this up is that when i first started coming here around  lurking i read a thread of a guy here that saw the exact thing i did with the slightly vshaped flashlight looking beam and the other blue sphere turning away id really love to read that again it was a good feeling to be somewhat confirmed i say confirmed because that friend robert that witnessed the sphere denied it in front of a lot of people at work we hardly talked about anything else on that trip and especially on the way home too assuming he felt as i did i brought it up when a bunch of guys were taking a break at work maybe  people i didnt see the harm in telling what we saw after i said my piece i said ask robert robert said i was crazy and he didnt see a thing i thought he was kidding but he was being serious youd think that on the way back hed say that he wasnt wanting to tell anyone but nooo edit on  by recrisp because typo',\n",

the october afternoon was cooling off as evening approached and jonathan could see his breath the coach trundled past wellmaintained stone gables and a heavy wroughtiron gate standing open on one side oil lanterns hung from black hooks in the gables glowed dimly in the fog and additional lanterns spilled pools of yelloworange light on a cobblestone drive as they made their way up toward the house

for with a delighted squeal she headed for the house they were greeted in the foyer by an elderly man jonathan estimated he was in his seventies hair fully white with deep creases in his face on age showing on his hands however the man was tall and straightbacked and he carried himself proudly there was a stiffness to his movements and he used a cane to walk but when jonathan shook his large hands the mans grip was as firm as a man half his age welcome he said warmly and with what jonathan thought was a german accent i am gottfried hansjürgen von graeff please be welcome in my home how

       " 'link hello again ats though we are two weeks out from election day as i sit to write these words  i find myself already looking beyond tuesday november the eighth and at some of the things that i think will happen between now and  as well as what i think the landscape will look like in the year leading up to that years election it wont be a popular opinion here on ats i am sure but as of today i feel confident in saying that short of some unprecedented and wholly unforseeable revelation or event  this years election is very likely a done deal hillary clinton will almost certainly be the next president of the united states with just two weeks remaining before election day  as of this writing  the metaanalysis of polls shows clinton possessing nearly an insurmountable lead while it is true that trump enjoys a very passionate and enthusiastic base he has done little to successfully expand that base the potential for him to find a means of connecting with undecided and uncommitted voters is minimal and shrinks with each passing day having come to this view i find myself free to look beyond the coming weeks and to try and get a handle on what a post  world will look like frankly gazing into my allegorical crystal ball i see dark and threatening clouds gathering on our horizon clouds that could very well bring a storm of epic proportions our way election night blues the night of tuesday november the eighth could well be historic  in the worst of ways this election cycle has broken several taboos and lowered the bar of political discourse in unprecedented ways it has been a season of highly divisive hyperbole and rhetoric that has builtup a great deal of social tension we currently sit atop a very very dry powder keg of anger that is seething and highly volatile passions will be flaring among many as we watch the election results stream in on our televisions computers and phones many of those watching will be deeply deeply emotionally invested in the outcome of this race in this climactic moment we as a nation will be perilously close to critical mass one spark away from potential disaster four years ago a man with some degree of fame was emotionally invested in that years election and he took to social media twitter to vent his reactions in a paroxysmal spasm of emotion that minor celebrity was one donald j trump source imagine for a moment what could happen if history repeats itself and this same man goes on a similar rant this election night imagine the violence such a display could potentially trigger then stop imagining and take a deep breath such a reaction is not just possible  given the evidence it is more than likely the probable outcome trump is currently heavily invested in telling his followers that the election is rigged that they have no voice and that he is the only one who can save them this is a very very dangerous and unstable bit of social chemistry most trump supporters obviously will not lash out in violence if their candidate loses the race  even if they personally feel that the outcome of the election was not legitimate however some trump supporters those in the extremes of what the media is currently calling the alt right very well could take to the streets in rage given some of the fringe support that trump enjoys i would honestly be surprised if such things were not already being planned by a handful of those on the fringe the rhetoric of revolution has been abused of late  and there are always the few who take such statements far too literally across the line blunty put  if election night comes and trump loses  and if he takes to twitter as he did four years ago  it could well result in a very long and bloody night a catastrophic night that we will look back upon with shame a night that could well poison our nation for years to come much ado about trump tv many pundits and wonks have mused over the fact that it truly does appear that trump has been laying the groundwork for a future media operation presumably a news network or service of some kind i count myself among those who have been suggesting so for a fairly long time however where i differ is that i dont see it as being quite so cut and dry any longer while i do think that trumps original thoughts  or more the thoughts of those who influence trump  was to create a new media conservative news venue i think that its now grown into something more i think that trump tv  or whatever they end up calling it  trump tv is too generic theres no inherent propaganda value in the name i think something more like trumps maga network is probably more on point  will be used as a device to begin a new political party more accurately to succeed where others have previously failed  im looking at you sarah palin and glenn beck  by congealing the various patriot tea party and fringe right wing groups into one collective and singular entity  a party firmly rooted in extreme nationalism with enough religion and conservatism thrown in to gain wider appeal my prediction is that donald trump will remain the focal point and figurehead of this coming movement  using this new network much as he currently utilizes his twitter feed a platform for him to vent his late night frustrations angers and insecurities his name will be predominantly used in the branding and messaging and trump will be the face of it all the most frequent speaker and guest imagine if the apprentice had been a  live streaming show  and trump had the power to walk in at any moment to say whatever happened to be on his mind that is how i see trump tv however i dont see trump being the driving force behind the actual message trump is a brand after all he has made his place in this world by putting his name on buildings he didnt build shows that he didnt create and ideas he didnt originate trump works as a spokesperson  the guy who says im not only the president of but im also a member the real people behind the curtain will be the mercers  robert and rebekah  steve bannon and to a lesser degree roger ailes as for on camera talents i think the current obvious potential faces of this new media enterprise will be hannity oreilly and lahren  though im honestly not personally sure if oreilly will make the jump money is money after all and big daddy bill is sitting pretty comfortably atop the fox news heap as his career winds down regardless however of who wins the backstage power war  other than the mercers who are a lock  and the on camera positions the network itself will be the propaganda arm of the extreme right wing and i think it very well could end up pulling the national discourse much further to the right in the coming  years particularly with the subjects of national isolationism and national identity politics',\n",

       " 'the moon that fell from heaven page  link there is an intriguing text from anatolian myth with regards to the moon falling from heaven the moon god fell from the sky and fell upon the gate complex but no one saw him the storm god sent rain after him he sent rains after him fear seized him anxiety seized him the god hapantali went there he stood beside him and uttered over him the words of a spell the goddess kamrusepa looked down from the sky and said what in the world has happened here a good question from kamrusepa there then but the text is fragmentary and partial and the matter isnt really explained so anyway the first question then is were was this gate complex and why couldnt he the moon be seen having landed my consideration is that the gate complex is that of the cilician gates  and that the moon can no longer be seen as he has infused the taurus mountains with silver that region did relate to the silver mountains as several sources mention and was a major centre for the trade in silver at kultepekanes the essence of the trade was to ship tin woolen textiles and lapis lazuli to anatolia to sell it there in order to acquire directly or indirectly silver and gold which was shipped back to assur tin essential for the anatoian production of bronze was imported in assur from susa perhaps by elamite caravans and ultimately originated from central asia assyrian trade colony at kanes there are a great many tablets related to this trade recovered from kultepe on these sometimes can be seen the taurus bull that bears upon its back the silver mountain also seen beneath on that example is the scorpion which was likely also an ideogram based upon the cilician gates and greater region also the symbol of ishara the goddess of the silver mountain and related to concept idea of the moon within the underworld her symbolic metal silver and purity through refinement the temple of ishara being at kanes or nesi to the hurrians there were a great many ideas bound up within this symbolism then including in cosmological terms the entrance into the underworld being above taurus in gemini and its opposite point of emergence in scorpio according to the intersection point of the galactic and ecliptic planes were this gets interesting is that there is a hurrian myth that relates to a conflict in the primeval period named the song of silver involving their tutelary god tessub and his ongoing issues with kumarbi god of destiny among tessub the sun god of the sky sauska ninevehs queen and all the gods no one worships him although his power is greater than their power his word is greater than their words his wisdom is greater than their wisdom his battle and his gory are greater than theirs it is silver the fine of whom i sing wise men tod me the story of the fatherless boy it did not exist long ago silvers father had disappeared and they do not know his spendor heroic men ran to battle abundance did not exist and grain did not grow only hunger the songs of the kumarbi cycle can contain veiled allegory regarding ethnic disputes such as i outlined here with regards to byblos and ebla it is likely the same in this case conflict with the region of nesa and the silver mountains this however relating to a much earlier period potentially also this relates to conflict from the heavens as silver could be named kubbabaranzu as noted here the association with anzu in conflict with tessub relating to the same with ninurta in the sumerian mythos and that seemingly from anatolia the identification of silver as dumu also correlates with the sumerian notion of the divine child as damu often seen as the basis for the cult of dumuzid were it was also the case that the city of dumuzid badtivira was the centre of the sumerian metallurgy industry silver is described in this text as a wannumiyas dumu which means a child whose father is dead or missing hittitologists generally translate this as orphan silvers consternation at being told by the orphan boy that he too was an orphan need not mean that he was discovering this for the first time the song of silver again is fragmentary but does seem to involve silver at some point establishing his power silver seized power with his hands silver seized the spear he dragged the sun and moon down from heaven the sun and the moon did reverence they bowed to silver the sun and the moon began to speak to silver o silver our lord do not strikekill us we are the luminaries of heaven and earth we are the torches of what lands you govern if you strikekill us you will proceed to govern the dark lands personally his soul within him was filled with lovehe had pity on them in dragging the sun and the moon down from heaven again it could be considered that is what had infused the mountains with gold and silver but also it could relate to the establishment of the cults of allani and ishara at the time of silver the spiritual qualities brought down to earth

irony and hypocrisy she has not only illegally declared herself leader of the southeast asian state in contravention of its constitution she has also embarked on an ironfisted purge of her political opponents identical to the one she fought against as she struggled to seize power to begin with \\nduring elections earlier this year myanmars constitution prevented suu kyi from holding the nations highest office due to her inordinate amount of time overseas her status of having been married to a foreign and her childrens dual citizenship instead of adhering to the law her party once in power simply contrived an entirely new post for her state counsellor of myanmar which makes her the defacto leader of myanmar \\ncanadas the globe and mail in an article titled stéphane dion says aung san suu kyi is the de facto leader of myanmar would note that canadas government recognized this legal sidestepping stating \\ndion called suu kyi now myanmars foreign minister the de facto national leader of her country because they have a strange rule that if you have married somebody whos not of the country you cannot be the leader of the government and of the state \\nsuu kyi the internationally recognized democracy advocate is barred from becoming president because her late husband was british as are her two sons the rule was crafted during myanmars decades of military rule which suu kyi fought against during years of house arrest before finally prevailing last fall \\nin essence she is unelected and illegally holding power for a woman whos western backers  particularly in the united states and united kingdom  have held her up as a champion for democracy and the rule of law she and her partys first act upon taking power was trampling both the inhumane humanitarian \\nanother myth built up around nobel peace prize laureate suu kyi by the west has been her advocacy for human rights her advocacy for human rights however appears only to extend out to protect only as far as her immediate political allies are concerned for groups beyond this selfserving political protection and particularly regarding her political opponents she and her ndl are just as eager to jail crush or kill political opponents as they claimed the ruling military government had been \\nin addition to escalating violence targeting the nations rohingyas population several activists online have been sent to jail for insulting the ruling government and westernbacked media fronts and organizations \\nmyanmars eleven media group emg in its article facebook offender brought to court for insulting suu kyi attempted to distance what suu kyi and her political supporters had once called draconian censorship as now a simple matter of enforcing the law it would state \\na facebook user named zaw zaw aka nga pha was brought to the north dagon township court on october  to face prosecution for his defamatory posts about state counsellor aung san suu kyi \\nhe has been charged under section d of the telecommunications law \\nhes being sued for defamatory writing and photos about the state counsellor posted on facebook said plaintiff nay myo kyaw a yearold resident of north okkalapa township \\naround  people showed up at the hearing wearing shirts affiliated with a group called the network of supporters of the rule of law they shouted you deserved it for insulting a good person \\nthe article also admits \\nthe myawady township court sentenced aung win hlaing aka a nyar thar the first man to be prosecuted under the current government for defamatory posts on facebook about president htin kyaw to nine months in jail after he was convicted under section d of the telecommunications law \\naung myint tun aka ko pho htaung a member of the national league for democracy is still facing legal action under the same law for the wording of a resignation letter \\nanother man named yar pyay was arrested and is being prosecuted for creating a fake facebook account under the name of nay myo wai the chairman of peace and diversity party \\nhla phone was also arrested and is being prosecuted for defamatory posts on facebook about the commanderinchief \\nemg  ironically awarded for its work in opposing the previous militaryled government by reporters without borders  would also admit that it itself had taken advantage of myanmars laws to silence its own critics claiming \\neleven media group emg also filed complaints about repeated defamatory posts on facebook against the group though emg lodged complaints against film director mike tee who is the owner of a facebook account named than tun zaw and another facebook user named myat maw for offensive posts about the group and its staff the legal process has yet to begin emg lodged the complaints on january  and march  this year \\none would expect such a tidal wave of abuse  as defined by the west in regards to media governance and censorship around the world  to be met with sweeping condemnation from the wests various human rights advocacy organizations including human rights watch amnesty international and a no doubt embarrassed reporters without borders  yet the silence is as deafening as it is telling taking over where accused dictators left off \\nthe wests champions of democracy rule of law and human rights in myanmar appears to have simply taken over right where suu kyi and her ndl party had claimed the militaryled government left off and despite the overt nature of suu kyis breaches of western standards of democracy and human rights the us is on track to lift all sanctions from myanmar as suu kyi and her government open the nation its people and its resources to exploitation by western corporations \\nthe overt nature of both the wests and suu kyis hypocrisy illustrates that democracy rule of law and human rights are merely facades behind which the west and its proxies wield their power  hiding behind such principles rather than truly upholding them and in reality such behavior undermines these principles more than any overt abuse by an openly tyrannical regime ever could  because genuine advocates thus become associated with hypocrites like the western governments supporting the current regime in myanmar their fauxnongovernmental organizations aiding and abetting the regime and proxies like suu kyi and her ndl themselves \\ninternational audiences must keep this example of hypocrisy in mind as the west attempts to overturn other governments in southeast asia and beyond under similar pretexts and using similar rhetoric

law court november  and   as a result of my not permitting an ami smart meter to be retrofitted on to my electric service by peco an exelon company that provides electricity and service to the suburban philadelphia where i live \\nthis testimony addresses most of the health legal and constitutional issues plus the politics involved regarding the unsafe and rfemf cancercausing technology forced on consumers along with threats of no electric service if utility customers refuse an ami smart meter \\nthere are four parts to the entire testimony that was  pages long plus  pages of exhibits a thru w and other documentation i had in my brief case not presented but as backup if needed that totaled in excess of three to four hundred pages of scientific documentation published research etc \\npersonally i think after reading the entire testimony which will appear in four parts readers can understand whats involved with unsafe fireprone and rfemfdirty electricityproducing ami smart meters when for decades utilities provided safe nonplastic parts analog meters before the administrative law court at the pa public utility commission philadelphia pa  november     \\nyour honor judge heep and judge pell members of the pa puc peco energy company the exelon legal team and all interested parties \\nsince today is the rescheduled postponed june   hearing and for which i catherine j frompovich submitted written testimony five days in advance of that previous hearing as per court rules i have decided to revise and include additional testimony interspersed into the previous  pages  pages of testimony and  pages of exhibits a thru q that i submitted via the us postal service and which all parties received i presume \\nhowever in view of the paramount importance plus dire consequences of emfsrfs being forced onto pennsylvania consumers with no optout for personal safety and protection from  nonionizing radiation emitted by ami smart meters microwave technology and my being a fiveyear breast cancer survivor i submit into testimony and evidence that the pa puc and all participating pennsylvania utilities not just peco as in my case must factor in the american with disabilities act amendments which redefine cancer as a disability especially since there are cancercausing effects from emfsrfs about which i submit into the record hundreds of documented scientific evidence as dozens of exhibits per the schedule of exhibits i now introduce plus printed documents i have with me in support of the fourpage bibliography of pertinent published literature regarding electromagnetic radiation cancer  ami smart meters that i also submit into the record as exhibit s  \\nsince the ada amendments act provides for three prongs of what constitutes a disability i am submitting into evidence a printout titled americans with disability act amendments act adaaa pointing out appropriate and applicable sections exhibit a  a twopage printout titled ada amendments redefine cancer as a disability exhibit a  along with a page dossier containing about  published studies regarding breast and other cancers and emfelfrf cancer studies exhibit a  and topping off those documents with a twopage letter dated  august  from the foremost emfrf researchers physicians and academics in the world written to the north carolina utilities commission exhibit a wherein in the third paragraph they state \\nsmart meters and cell phones occupy similar frequency bands of the electromagnetic spectrum meaning that cell phone research can apply to smart meter rfr smart meter rfr consists of frequent very intense but very brief pulses throughout the day because smart meter exposure over a  hour period can be very prolonged  pulses can average  times a day  and because there is building evidence that the sharp high intensity pulses are particularly harmful  the cell phone study findings are applicable when discussing adverse health impacts from smart meters \\nthose five researchers david carpenter md director institute for health and the environment university of albany dr lennart hardell md phd professor department of oncology university hospital orebro sweden dr magda havas bsc phd environmental  resources studies trent university canada dr martha herbert md phd assistant professor of neurology harvard medical school pediatric neurologist and neuroscientist at the massachusetts general hospital boston dr sam milham md mph former chief epidemiologist washington state department of health \\npoint out in the last sentence of the first paragraph  it is imperative that the north carolina utilities commission be fully aware of the harm that rfr can cause and allow utility customers to opt out of smart meter installation with no penalty \\nfrompovich respectfully points out and also cautions the pa puc that in not permitting opt outs from ami smart meters in pennsylvania during formulating its ami sm regulations since hb stated ami sms were not to be mandated  it has breached ethical and legal standards regarding unsafe ami sms regarding the rfrs they emit various states have permitted safe electric power usage by granting and implementing ami sms opt outs which the pa puc deliberately refused in formulating its utility regulations regarding ami sms thereby subjecting consumers to unknown adverse health effects which in essence violate the nuremberg code since consumers consent was not required nor asked and their use apparently amounts to an experiment on pecos customers \\nagain frompovich points to the letter addressed to the ncuc exhibit a at the end of the second paragraph wherein those researchers cite the us ntp june  study conclusion in part stating adds proof to the conclusions from the human health studies that radiofrequency radiation increases risk of cancer  \\nfrompovich further elaborates that cell phone rfr exposure is elective  ie depending upon personal choice use and an individuals ability to turn off cell phones thereby reducing andor avoiding similar frequency microwave bands and rfrs exposures both cell phones and ami sms produce \\nhowever harmful personal bodily rfr exposure has been mandated by pa puc regulationsnot hbact   and therefore is absolutely illegal since act  does not defy nor negate the pennsylvania state constitutions inherent rights of mankind section  but its the commonwealths regulatory agencythe pa pucthat is guilty of nonfulfillment i allege \\nall men and women are born equally free and independent and have certain inherent and indefeasible rights among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty of acquiring possessing and protecting property and reputation  and of pursuing their own happiness  pennsylvania constitution section  \\nhowever contrary to that pennsylvania constitutional right is the fact that mandated ami smart meter rfr exposure because of no opt outs in pennsylvania specifically via pa puc regulations not act  literally provides no way to escape andor avoid ami sms microwave rfrs that is illegal and should be prosecuted criminally frompovich contends furthermore the pa puc overstepped its agency powers and frompovich contends is guilty of committing ultra vires during its rulemaking process \\nthe above five researchers exhibit a delineate cell phone and smart meters as basically the same animal because both occupy similar frequency bands on the electromagnetic spectrum see paragraph  of their letter to the ncuc for more detail including that smart meters over a hour period can average  pulses a day causing high intensity pulses known as dirty electricity  \\ni submit into the record exhibit a dirty electricity or dirty power and the page report why are electromagnetic fields dangerous  is dirty electricity making you sick including  charts  table  ranking electric meters and table  ranking electric meters for risk of privacy and cyber security from the page report ranking electricity meters for risk to health privacy and cyber security available online at httpswwwscribdcomdocrankingelectricitymetersforrisktohealthprivacyandcybersecurity  \\nthe key dispute and multifaceted issue of concern in frompovichs case  being a breast cancer survivor in excess of five years  is her free and legal exercise of legal and constitutional rights to be free of the fear exposure to cancercausing emfs andor actuality of contracting cancer due to ami sm rfr exposures  in her homesomething that the ada amendments act indisputably encompass since once a cancer patient that makes frompovich covered within one of the adaaa prongs for all time and also includes frompovichs indefeasible right to protect property both her home and her personal body and its life processes including her reputation \\nthat federal adaaa must be factored into frompovichs case since peco has obtained federal grant monies to implement its ami smart meters rollout and the law states that any business that accepts federal grant money is mandated to abide by the adaaa including state regulatory agencies like the pa puc \\nfrompovichs refusal of an ami sm plus her human and innate right to protect her health body and property are more than confirmed when those five researchers point out  the strongest evidence for hazards coming from rfr is cancer  there is a growing body of evidence that some people develop a condition called electrohypersensitivity ehs see paragraph  of the letter to ncuc exhibit a  \\non page  paragraph  of that same letter the researchers further point out a dichotomy in science which is the very fact that independent research versus industry research studies are at coincidental if not predictable  variances as per the chart i raise up and submit into the record  a doublesided poster radiofrequency research does funding matter which shows two pie charts depicting those conflicting statistics \\nnonindustry studies indicate  harmful effects with  no effects while industry studies indicate   harmful effects with  no effects statistically thats almost a wash as each just about cancels the other however theres a slight edge of  from nonindustry studies indicating harmful effects more interestingly though is that industry studies did find  harmful effects studiesalmost onethird of the studies and yet the industry concludes differently stating there are none that alone should be a red flag for them or anyone of scientific mind to investigate further and they did not which indicates some sort of collusion of not wanting to know or find out is that a crime of omission or collusion \\nparagraph  on page  of that letter exhibit a cites the obvious crux of scientific and ethical issues regarding ami smart meters in pennsylvania in particular stating with a leading nc dhhs staff member admitting that he is not qualified to review the literature and the fact that he relied on industry representatives for assistance the dhhs conclusion is not surprising \\nfrompovich feels compelled to question how much of that microwave technology industry representative assistance occurred and still occurs with and from peco and the pa puc thereby illegally depriving frompovich and all pennsylvanians of their rights to protect their health and property along with the exercise of redress against what amounts to experimental ami smart meter science whose proponents wantonly do not recognize nonthermal adverse health effects from rfrs which have been known since  i introduce exhibit t electrosensitivity es and electromagnetic hypersensitivity ehs into the record to document that in    and  various health issues have been identified with emf nonthermal exposures \\nyour honors i respectfully ask the court to instruct peco to produce the experimental studies rather than epidemiological studies indicating no nonthermal effects from emfsrfs wheres the science \\narent pecos customers entitled to have that evidence \\nfrompovich also feels compelled to ask this court the following how much influence did the microwave industry contribute to pa state representative robert godshalls campaign coffers andor his preferred charities that apparently has enabled godshall as chair of the pa house consumer affairs committee to sit on opt out bills in the pa legislature for several legislative sessions including godshalls verbal proclamations to others that he will never bring opt out bills to the floor for a vote which obviously is an impeachable offence for depriving pennsylvanians of their right to redress government and government agency oppressions that enable utility companies to harass and bully customers about cutting off electric service if they refuse fireprone ami sms in pennsylvania \\nheres what other us states have done regarding ami smart meters \\nanalog meters are definitively offered as the optout meter in four states arizona california maine and texas the nevada public

chairman representative godshall is allowing three more opt out bills to become sine die this session which should amount to an impeachable offense for denying consumers their inherent and indefeasible rights especially of redress to government and also according to the pennsylvania constitution i contend \\nprobably nothing encapsulates and explains the emfrfr controversy or conundrum if you may from a scientific viewpoint than the page report  europaem emf guideline  for the prevention diagnosis and treatment of emfrelated health problems and illnesses  which is a spanish language document and found online at httpslistasumessympaarcanunciosmsghtml this report cites  published scientific references which leaves frompovich to question why the pa pucand peco in particularare so daft in proffering that there is no updated science other than the s era safety thermal science regarding microwave electromagnetic energies based in ancient radar studies the microwave industry always trots out as proof of safety \\nthose safety studies originated in germany during world war ii are totally outmoded but remain the present federal communications commissions rules regarding safety of cell phones and ami smart meters it is now  how come s microwave technology science is being applied as the gold standard or scientific criterion to meters that will become the key intelligence gathering technology for the internet of things frompovich has to question the credibility factor of both peco and the pa puc for depending upon  science in todays technology world of  wheres the science later than the s please may i have those studies peco supplied to the pa puc \\nfrompovich therefore respectfully suggests that the pa puc study the aboveaforementioned european reports with medical and ehs health professionals who are qualified to explain the diagnostics and varied modalities discussed in order to issue updated regulations affecting ami smart meters and their continuous rfremf healthdamaging electromagnetics plus their fireandexplosionprone proclivities and occurrences which definitely was not the case for all the decades utilities used safe and efficient analog meters \\nchildren are the most vulnerable to emf radiation and therefore i introduce exhibit u why children absorb more microwave radiation than adults the consequences and exhibit u american academy of pediatrics august   letter urging the food and drug administration commissioner the federal communications commission and others to advise the public about specific absorption rates sars regarding emfrf exposures \\nalso i want to apprise every one of the fact that electromagnetic sensitivity ehs is a growing problem and according to recently reported statistics in the peer reviewed journal ecopsychology professor pamela reed gibson states the following  of the usa population  of the swedish population  of the danish population and   of the german population are ehs compromised see exhibit v  however other sources claim that as much as  of the entire worlds population is affected \\njust as chemical sensitivities were discredited and denied by medical doctors for yearsnow referred to as sick building syndrome or multiple chemical sensitivity mcsso too is ehs now being recognized by many including the world health organization i introduce exhibit w electrohypersensitivity a functional impairment due to an inaccessible environment printout available here httpsdocsgooglecomvieweravpidforumssrcidmdgxodkwotknjuotuodqwntybmtuntizmdamtqxntynzintcbtvrzdgfeounbuufkataumqebdji \\nas exhibit x i introduce a study no one can refute a review on electromagnetic fields emfs and the reproductive system which outlines science the microwave industry peco and all utilities utilizing ami smart meters plus public utility commissions across the usa need to factor into the inevitable legal liability that they are assuming by committing crimes against humanity by exposing the population to unsafe microwave electromagnetics  from dirty electricity pulsed by ami sms onto home wiring and into private residences and all buildings retrofitted with ami smart meters \\nbefore i include my previously submitted testimony i find it necessary to impress upon the court that it should not be frompovichs obligation to prove the medical consequences beyond a reasonable doubt especially in light of the ada amendments act as it applies to those receiving federal funding or even that the consequences of medical problems are more probable than not since the adaaa provides frompovich with disability rights and protections which peco and the pa puc must abide by \\nfurthermore it should be the indisputable duty of peco and all pennsylvania utility companies  but more specifically that of the pa public utility commissions stated mission for being  to provide safe and nonradiating innovations in utility technology and appliances with  certainty which ami smart meters fail on numerous levels especially with their proclivity for hot sockets fires and explosions emfrf constant emissions and dirty electricity pulses as frequent as  times a day \\nno medicalscientific testing has proved ami smart meters emfs safety regarding nonthermal adverse health effects that i know of wheres the science \\ntherefore frompovich should not be forced to allow a provenfireprone ami smart meter electric service on her property that would radiate dirty electricity into her residence with high rfr pulses every fifteen seconds \\njust to add more salt to the wound as they would say there are no assurances that monitoring is not part and parcel of the ami smart meter agenda and an integral surveillance device of the internet of things or that information will be shared with unknown third partiesfor whatever reasonsand for which frompovich does not approve nor give her permission to peco the pa puc or any government agencies or agents \\ntherefore frompovich feels her privacy as well as her home and personal physiology will be subjected to unlawful unconstitutional and unnecessary interventions at various levels and specifically without proper legal processes eg courtissued warrants in order to surveil her home that automatically will occur from the twoway zigbee radio transmitter system of ami sms and all smart appliances which are built to interact with the coming surveillance technology of the internet of things the times frompovich makes tea in the morning and shuts off her lights for the night are no ones business but her own \\nive been researching consumer health issues and whatsoever affects human health negatively  including technologies since the late s during my career i was considered an expert witness providing testimony before several states legislaturelegislative hearings on health issues for numerous years i was ahead of both the popular curve and the allopathic paradigm of medicine regarding the role of diet nutrition epigenetics and lifestyle issues in maintaining optimum health avoiding disease and regaining health utilizing holistic health principles \\ni am in my  th year thank god since the early s when i almost lost my life due to unfortunate medical mistakes and had to remove myself from mainstream allopathic care in order to save my life ive been immersed in whats called the holistic lifestyle ive beaten the odds including being a breast cancer survivor using holistic healthcare modalities for the record  of us adults and  of us children used whats referred to as cam in  per nih statistics complementary and alternative medicinecam as its called is popular throughout the world while in the us there is the national center for complementary and integrative health at the national institutes of health \\nhowever the allopathic paradigm considers it quite frankly a pain in its professional butt since cam has become the go to healthcare system when allopathy fails one \\ntherefore i expect that i probably will educate misinformed individuals on the negative health consequences of electromagnetic frequencies from microwave energy producing technologies like cell phones and towers wifi smart gadgets and in particular ami smart meters which are being bullyforced onto electric natural gas and municipal water utility customers most state legislators the media and the public are undeniably ignorant of the damage being done to their health fortunately i am not one of those people thus my refusing an ami smart meter on my house but first i think you ought to know some of my background im a wellinformed plus over  years published consumer health researcher advocateactivist journalist and author \\nthat i should be taken seriously i offer some of my professional background retired practicing natural nutritionist former registered lobbyist with the us congress for five years representing holistic healthcare issues executive director for the national coalition for alternatives in nutrition and healthcare canah for five years and as such presented fdasolicited expertise input regarding holistic health practices for its  ota report otah ntis pb unconventional cancer treatments  expert nutrition witness before a congressional subcommittee opposing food irradiation government relations specialist for a consortium of natural nutrition supplement makers before the us food and drug administration the first government relations specialist for the life extension foundation who set up lefs government relations department a published journalist author of numerous books regarding health and lifestyle issues with several books available on amazoncom and my  book eat to beat disease foods medicinal qualities \\nadditionally i wrote and produced two tv shows one called  turn off the violence  was nominated for a telly award that hourlong show was instrumental in securing the giraffe award given to persons who stick out their necks for the common good the recipient was george mason university staff member connie kirkland who founded a hour crisis center for rape victims and promoted oncampus nonviolence educational campaigns specifically relating to rape and domestic violence what ive shared is much less than half of my background more would take too much of your time however i feel compelled to ask how many people can match my qualifications to discuss consumer health issues \\nfurthermore i want to underscore upfront that if i were a habitual drug addict rather than an informed concerned healthconscious researcher and consumer being harassed for trying to protect and preserve my health i probably would be welcomed with open arms plus there would be all types of programs and subsidies available for help because i am opposing faulty and healthdamaging rfemf science plus vestedinterest snooping surveillance and customer data marketing agendas using ami smart meters i am harassed and even threatened with termination of electric service even though all my bills are paid in full that leaves me with no options but to dutifully invoke and defend my state and federal constitutional rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness isnt there something radically wrong with such a construct especially in the usa if i have to do that \\nattorney ward smiths interrogatory requesting frompovichs cancer health records quite frankly leaves everyone with whom ive shared that fact totally aghast and amazed why because frompovichs medical records are her personal information protected under hippa and i must protect them furthermore since the puc administrative law court hearing is of public record frompovich does not want her personal medical records made public information during any level in these proceedings as that is her fundamental right \\ni respectfully bring to this courts attention that my breast cancer and medical records are not the issue whats the issue problem and at stake not only for me but for all pennsylvanians is the total callous disregard by utility companiespeco included the pa puc and the commonwealth for health hazards safety and the wellbeing of all pennsylvanians especially those with health issues compromised immune systems disabilities and especially young growing childrenfetuses in particularwhom rfemf and dirty electricity produced by ami smart meters affect and impact negatively \\nbefore presenting into the record additional reams of recent research with documentation and annotationsnot s vintage radar safety researchfor rfsemfs and microwave electromagnetic energies impacts upon cancer and health i feel it necessary to introduce something no one probably has thought about nor factored into the ami smart meter hidden costs continuum  and that is healthcare services and ancillary costs stemming from nonionizing radiation rfsemfs smart meters impact upon human tissue \\nthere are mounting underlying longterm adverse health effects accruing as we speak from pa pucpeco forced ami smart meter  rfemf electromagnetics pulses harmonics and dirty electricity specifically adverse nonthermal health effects impacting children and an ageing pa population which will generate dire fiscal consequences plus responsibilities upon penna medicaid health cost line items in each years operating budget for the commonwealth \\nto cement that forewarning i offer the world health organizations statistic approximately  of reported cases of ehs electromagnetic hypersensitivity were considered severe which means specialized caregiving that however does not include cancerinduced health issues from rfsemfs what kind of budget shortfall will ami smart meters adverse health effects eventually generate for pas legislature and governor to haggle about when weve seen whats been going on recently to get a state budget passed has anyone thought

       " 'by whitney webb \\nover the course of this years us presidential election which has been nothing if not bizarre some have repeatedly speculated that the election may not actually happen at all if an opportunely timed terrorist attack or other major event occurred at just the right moment leading to a suspension of the november election now these theories appear to have more credence as sources within us intelligence have contacted pat milton a cbs news senior investigative producer warning him that terrorist attacks in three us states are highly likely come this monday the day before the us election us intelligence has allegedly alerted joint terrorism task forces that al qaeda not isis could be planning attacks in new york texas and virginia no specific locations within those three states were mentioned \\nus authorities are said to be taking the threat seriously though cbs news  sources stress that the threat is still being assessed and its credibility has yet to be confirmed according to cbs  counterterrorism officials were alerted to the threat out of an abundance of caution \\nearlier this week there were also warnings that polling places could be seen as attractive targets for lone wolf attackers by individuals motivated by violent extremist ideologies sovereign citizen or other extremist activity this has led federal law enforcement to plan for several worstcase scenarios one fbi official told cbs  \\nthe counterterrorism and homeland security communities remain vigilant and wellpostured to defend against attacks here in the united states the fbi working with our federal state and local counterparts shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety \\nhowever whats interesting here is that the terror threat is coming from al qaeda as opposed to the islamic state in the syrian civil war the us has been actively helping al qaeda there grouping their syrian branch  the al nusra front  in with the moderate rebels they support therefore al qaedas ability to launch attacks within the us has been directly aided by us intelligence making this announcement incredibly suspect \\nits also worth pointing out that al qaeda since its inception has been a product of the us intelligence community in the s they were essentially created by the us to fight the soviets in afghanistan ever since they have conveniently been used as the justification for an expansion of us wars abroad and the elimination of civil liberties domestically \\nit is also interesting that the threat is al qaeda and not the islamic state the islamic state has been the terrorist bogeyman of recent years and their involvement in any threat real or imagined is useful justification for escalating us involvement in syria it seems highly likely that the islamic state was left out due to recent revelations from wikileaks showing that their funding comes from the very same entities that donate millions to the clinton foundation \\nit is also worth noting that if a terrorist attack does come to pass it will be a big help for hillary hillary has been under siege in recent weeks due to wikileaks near constant releases of her campaign chairs emails but also due to the fbis mutiny which led them to reopen a probe into clintons use of a private email server any terror attack would give clinton the opportunity to gain political ground by promoting her aggressive foreign policy aims in syria and the rest of the middle east \\nhowever as mentioned at the beginning of this article it is also possible that a terrorist attack on us soil would give president obama the authority to either postpone or outright cancel the election something he could not normally do except in the event of extraordinary circumstances unfortunately only time will tell which theory is correct compelling us to stay vigilant in the meantime \\nwhat are your thoughts please comment below and share this news',\n",

presidency the great migration of republicans into the democratic party tent of hillary clinton has guaranteed her victory in the highly undemocratic us presidential elections corporate media outlets have collaborated with clinton to instill deep popular fear of a trump administration fear of trump has been used to distract the many millions of people in the us who are fed up with both corporate parties this has led to a lack of investigation and analysis of what can be expected once hillary clinton actually takes office\\nthe corporate media has exploited the general populations distaste for sexism and white supremacy in the process trump has made heinous statement after heinous statement all of which should be taken seriously by anyone who calls themselves a movement activist it is critical that the left in the us extend solidarity to those who experience the consequences of racism and sexism every day however trumps vile character has been used as a means to legitimize the candidacy of hillary clinton his characterization as a fascist has convinced many that his rule would be a greater danger to humanity than a clinton presidency\\none could endlessly debate clinton supporters on the validity of such a claim trumps vulgar and putrid presentation has provided clinton supporters with a convenient weapon of defense against all criticism of their own vile choice yet the lesser evil argument has never been weaker than in the  elections it is reasonable to assume that a hillary clinton presidency will be far less effective than obama in effecting capitalist and imperialist hegemony this is why her support system the entire ruling class has gone into overdrive to spread fear of a russiatrump collaborative threat in every sphere of us political life\\nhere are ten things to expect from a clinton presidency i will leave it to readers to judge as to whether clinton represents a lesser evil than trump or just plain evil\\n the privatization of social security  hillary clinton has stated publicly and privately to her wall street friends that she will reignite conversations to downsize the program wikileaks exposed clintons support for the obamas administrations deficit reduction commission that originally proposed cuts to entitlements such as social security and medicare in  clinton donors on wall street have made it clear that they would love to get a hold of social security earnings and turn them into a financial market to be traded for profit\\nmore hillary clinton must be indicted how hillary clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital voting for the lesser evil john pilger clinton policies will bring great aggression to the us and the world  world war iii  hillary clinton has stated in nearly every debate that her administration would consider placing a nofly zone in syria that means us airstrikes would rain down on syrian and russian assets in syria such a move would place the us military in direct confrontation with the russia clinton has been caught stating that the syrian and russian lives that will die in such a conflict are well worth the benefits\\n the transpacific partnership  often called nafta on steroids the massive corporate trade agreement that captures much of asia pacific region has been a major talking point in the  elections clinton has supported the agreement in the past only to switch her position due to pressure from the bernie sanders campaign with sanders firmly in the clinton camp there is currently nothing in the way to stop clinton from moving forward with the tpps passage and making her private position on the deal a public reality\\n maintenance and expansion of the surveillance state  not much needs to be said here the obama administrations vast expansion of the surveillance state has been exposed by the likes of ed snowden and julian assange wikileaks additionally revealed clintons desire to drone julian assange for releasing washingtons secrets to the public a clinton presidency has every intention of following up on the obama administrations passage of bills such as the national defense authorization act of  this bill gave the us government the right to militarily detain terror suspects indefinitely\\n trumps wall  hillary clinton was obamas secretary of state from  over this time she helped facilitate the largest deportation of undocumented people in us history furthermore she oversaw the detention of thousands of central american children during the great migration from the  fascist coup in honduras a coup that was drawn up by clinton herself the usmexico border is more militarized than it has ever been trumps wall rhetoric was indeed a racist trip but too few recognize that something just as dangerous actually exists under current us immigration policy\\n servitude to the bankers  hillary clinton has received over forty million in support from hedge funds in the  elections before selling out bernie sanders made it a point to request public access into clintons private quarter million dollar speeches to banks like goldman sachs the deregulation of the banks with the passage of the glasssteagall act was a clinton project both her current list of donors and past connection to her husbands policies make her the obvious choice for the finance capitalist class\\n maintenance of the mass black incarceration state  hillary clinton is the enemy of black america from her callous use of the term super predator to describe working class black men to being the architect of the  crime bill the clinton dynasty virtually built the mass black incarceration state under bill and hillary clintons two terms the prison population rose by  this was facilitated by draconian three strikes laws mandatory drug sentence and the deep militarization of local police departments with her record it isnt too difficult to assume what another four years of clinton rule will bring in the realm of policing and prisons\\n austerity and more austerity  it was the first clinton administration that eliminated welfare as we know it the evisceration of aid to families and dependent children afdc and its replacement temporary assistance to needy families tanf threw millions of women and children into poverty obama has followed up with draconian cuts to snap foodstamps there is nothing on clintons track record that indicates her administration would do anything but roll back whatever social programs and protections still exist for the poor in the us\\n a boost to the privatization of education  hillary clinton received boos in july when she urged teachers unions and charter operators to work together for the greater good of students ever since clinton has attempted to exploit the rise of sanders by courting teachers unions to endorse her her position has slightly softened on the privatization of education but that hardly matters clinton receives broad support from school privatizers like walmart and should not be expected to roll back the shock and awe war on public education waged by the obama administration\\n an economic crisis  bankers and economists have been predicting an economic crash for much of  capitalists everywhere were given free rein to recover with trillions in stimulus cash after sending the entire global capitalist economy into collapse in  the internal contradictions of the system are only sharpening as workers become poorer and global production stagnates whether clinton can manage a crisis in service of the capitalists as well obama has remains to be seen\\nclinton may very well be the highest expression of ruling class consensus that has ever presented itself in an election season her political record represents a greater material threat to humanity than donald trump for the sheer fact that she is the preferred candidate of the ruling class the question now is whether mass sentiment exists to organize around an alternative to the twoparty corporate duopoly jill stein and ajamu baraka are attempting to build the base of the green party ticket whatever method is chosen it must be wielded to combat lesser evil politics and build an organized force ready to struggle against the intensified suffering that will surely be imposed on the world by a clinton administration',\n",

candor and grandiose proclamations she is working her way back into the favor of disgruntled democrats and even right wing firebrands like the notorious glenn beck she is without question a wolf in sheeps clothing while trump is unbelievably hard to take constantly we need to focus on one simple question which of these candidates will lead to world devastation first\\ni suspect it would be hillary clinton who would be most inclined toward involving americans in another military conflict and she doesnt go small as she constantly demonizes russia with threats of military action in clintons own words youve seen reports russia has hacked into a lot of things china has hacked into a lot of things russia even hacked into the democratic national committee maybe even some state election systems so weve got to step up our game make sure we are well defended and can take the fight to those who go after us as president i will make it clear that the united states will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack we will be ready with serious political economic and military responses\\nmilitary responses to a nation the us stood on the verge of war with for more than four decades military response against russia over suspected hacking hillary clinton betrayed her real mindset once and for all during the recent debate with donald trump when she spoke those words of war that would surely lead to only disastrous consequences\\nit all stems from the wikileaks release that included  emails and  attachments from leaders at the democratic national committee clinton says the russians did it the national mainstream media parroted those words its the american medias political conditioning system at its finest convincingly reaching tens of millions of americans and yet nobody knows if the blame is properly attributed to the russians in a usa today article from july  elizabith weise wrote computer security researchers say its difficult to definitively say the cyber theft of files from the democratic national committee subsequently posted online by wikileaks was the work of russian hackers as some media outlets have reported\\nrussias leader vladmir putin says the us long ago tipped the scales in the wrong direction well before the cold war even ended peace with russia should be a top priority for any us presidential candidate the truth is that american politicians perpetually convinced they are making the right political moves created a road block on the highway to peace during the vietnam war putin said during the st petersburg international economic forum  it is not in my nature to scold someone  but when the united states unilaterally withdrew from the abm treaty in  they delivered a colossal blow to the entire system of international security that was the first blow when it comes to assessing the strategic balance of power in the world\\nmore  things to expect with a hillary clinton presidency hillary clinton must be indicted how hillary clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital voting for the lesser evil now we have clinton warmongering over unfounded allegations\\nworld rivals in the air\\nthere is a decadesold history of rivalry between eastern and western jet fighter design and technology while american designs are more expensive and generally considered to be better the fastest jet fighter ever made is the russian mig it can break mach iii more than three times the speed of sound such demands lessen the life of an aircraft the mig is typically not flown at anything close to that speed as an interceptor however it was supreme no allied fighter in the sky could outrun it\\nthe korean war was the first test soviet migs initially dominated the skies with russian and chinese pilots often at the controls the migs were deadly\\non  november  at least sixteen american f fighters p mustangs were shot at by six soviet mig interceptors led by soviet wwii ace mayor nikolay v stroykov the wwii prop planes like the mustang along with the us f shooting star and f thunderjet jet fighters had a job on their hands fighting the robust and highly maneuverable mig fighters\\neverything changed when the us air force launched the f sabre wikipedia explains that the f sabre pilots enjoyed advantages they learned to exploit to the fullest foremost among those was a radar ranging gun sight on their six  caliber machine guns which ensured that even short bursts of fire generally found their target f pilots were also equipped with gsuits which prevented pilot blackout in highspeed turning maneuvers\\nit is unlikely that anybody will ever fully agree on the casualties and kill ratios over mig alley during the korean war\\nthe soviets claimed  united nations planes of all types shot down including about  sabres the usaf only admits to losing less than  aircraft in air combat\\nthe f pilots claimed  migs shot down while b gunners claimed a further  these numbers were later reduced to  migs the chinese air force claimed only  kills\\nin vietnam the competitors varied the mig and mig fighters were widely used by the north vietnamese air force they fought planes like the f super sabre f tiger and the f phantom once again if you believe western sources which are fairly reliable for the most part the us planes dominated in most air to air combat though the other side had plenty of talented pilots and more aces overall than the americans during the end of the cold war in the s the soviet mig was the terror of the skies there was more speculation about it than real knowledge at first while mig aircraft were only built in odd numbers the movie top gun references the aircraft by calling them migs  migs no ones been this close before the planes used in the movie were actually american f tigers painted black with red stars applied to the tails today the united states spends obscene amounts on planes like the f raptor and these aircraft do not have any clear advantages over modern russian planes like the su both in this case are capable of thrust vectoring which means the pilot can change the direction of the jet blast and create an entirely separate way to control the jet in flight the ultimate western jet in the world of thrust vectoring is the avb harrier which can actually take off and land like a helicopter hopefully the world will not have to put these machines against each other in a future war but with clinton at the helm it is entirely possible and the advantages the us used to hold over the russian military have evaporated into thin air\\nrussias modern approach to warfare\\nduring the decadeslong cold war the soviet union operated under archaic rules that essentially prevented a commander or a pilot from knowing their mission until they were dispatched to carry out the order kemp freund a us army sergeant major that i met while i was covering the war in afghanistan was quote d in my  video report camp joyce remote fire base near afghanistanpakistan border saying were trying to break the old soviet methods that they use and the soviet method had that lt col completely in the dark until he needed to move he added were still working with the higher echelons to get that to move downhill the soviet ways were detrimental and offered little freedom to a trained soldier or pilot but all that is over now todays russian pilots not only fly superior aircraft that cost far less than us taxpayer funded military planes they also utilize tactics of western pilots hillary clinton surely knows these facts but she wants to play with fire and be another war president which was so important to former president george w bush and obama too for that matter\\nother looming conflicts\\nlest we forget hillary clintons unwavering support of israel the apartheid religious nuclear state that has long been protected by us taxpayer money and military hardware the government of right wing israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu continues to violate the human rights of palestinians constantly while building settlements which are completely illegal under international law then there are the attacks in gaza that target schools and hospitals leaving hundreds and hundreds dead and thousands severely injured never does clinton speak out against the barbaric treatment israel reserves for nonjews never does she refer to the fact that the country we now call iran hasnt attacked a nation outside of its borders for more than three hundred years yet iran has been savagely attacked by

       " ' shares\\n   \\nthe anarchist political observer noam chomsky has over the years espoused a strategy of voting for the democrat in swing states recently chomsky with john halle propounded  an eight point brief for lev lesser evil voting \\nchomsky questions the ethicalmoral principle rejecting lev since lesser evil voting is designed to minimize evil as futile as lesser evilism is it is also futile to discuss there being a lesser evilism between the two utterly dominant rightist political parties in the united states lev in fact is an equally contemptible or greater evil\\nchomsky though sensibly cautions that challenges to the politicalbusiness duopoly needs to be contemplated with a full awareness of their possible consequences what are the possible consequences chomsky suggests a trump presidency should it materialize will undermine the burgeoning movement centered around the sanders campaign particularly if it is perceived as having minimized the dangers posed by the far right however another consequence is equally possible a horrendous slide to the right would spur progressives to coalesce among a leftist democrat andor it might finally cause former or potential democrats to reject the chicanery of the businessdominated democrats and embrace the progressivist platform of the green party\\nthis costbenefit strategic accounting seriously pushes for progressivist change\\nfocusing on the electoral system however must not be the endall and beall for bringing about progressivism in the us grassroots organizing and activism must continue to inform oppose poverty and impoverishment oppose war and violence and push for human rights and equal opportunity for all people  during electoral periods and between election cycles\\nmore  and the zionist

israel  part   and the zionist question is noam chomsky a disinfo agent for israel  part  i examine halle and chomskys eight point brief for lev\\n voting should not be viewed as a form of personal selfexpression or moral judgement directed in retaliation towards major party candidates who fail to reflect our values or of a corrupt system designed to limit choices to those acceptable to corporate elites\\nno argument with this\\n the exclusive consequence of the act of voting in  will be if in a contested swing state to marginally increase or decrease the chance of one of the major party candidates winning\\nthis is true of the individual act of voting the individual in solitude has little sway over the electoral result that is an obvious given however when a consciousness sweeps across a multitude of likeminded individuals then enormous potentials emerge this desire for a change from the effete status quo is arguably what occurred with the almost breakthrough candidacy of bernie saunders and it is also what happened in a dissimilar manner with the candidacy of donald trump chomsky has framed the exclusive consequence of the act of voting as the result of an individualistic action and it is but individuals can and do at times form a wider consciousness measurable by statistically rigorous polling results that has potential ramifications on a much greater scale that mere margins an example of this would be the expression of voter disgust in the canadian federal election of  following two successive majority governments led by the brian mulroney tories a voting tsunami washed away all but two tory seats in the seat parliament the conservatives had been around since  but the electoral demolition led to the eventual dissolution of the tories\\n one of these candidates trump denies the existence of global warming calls for increasing use of fossil fuels dismantling of environmental regulations and refuses assistance to india and other developing nations as called for in the paris agreement the combination of which could in four years take us to a catastrophic tipping point trump has also pledged to deport  million mexican immigrants offered to provide for the defense of supporters who have assaulted african american protestors at his rallies stated his openness to using nuclear weapons supports a ban on muslims entering the us and regards the police in this country as absolutely mistreated and misunderstood while having done an unbelievable job of keeping law and order trump has also pledged to increase military spending while cutting taxes on the rich hence shredding what remains of the social welfare safety net despite pretenses\\nmuch of what trump stands for is anathema true there is no need to defend this man however trump stakes out important positions diametrical to hillary clinton for example clintons advocacy of a nofly zone over syria her saber rattling with russia her corporatefriendly policy toward socalled free trade deals\\nchomsky cleverly anticipated such an objection writing\\n with respect to point  which some will challenge by citing the claim that clintons foreign policy could pose a more serious menace than that of trump\\nin any case while conceding as an outside possibility that trumps foreign policy is preferable most of us not already convinced that that is so will need more evidence than can be aired in a discussion involving this statement furthermore insofar as this is the fact of the matter following the logic through seems to require a vote for trump though its a bit hard to know whether those making this suggestion are intending it seriously\\nfirst chomsky concedes an outside possibility that trumps foreign policy is preferable in other words chomsky posits an inside possibility one assumes that chomsky is saying that there is the strongest likelihood that clintons foreign policy is preferable without any substantiation of why this would be so second he raises an unreasonable demand for evidence that trump will follow a less menacing foreign policy than clinton given that trump has never held political office no such evidence exists what does exist is plenty of evidence that clinton will pursue a menacing foreign policy there is no reason to assume clinton would reduce the number of american military bases overseas or curtail military spending in fact it is likelier that she would increase military spending she will also likeliest resort to a us military attack to bring about regime change in syria pushing the us closer to military confrontation with russia trumps detractors compare his bombastic rhetoric unfavorably to clintons rhetoric but toward putin or assad clintons undiplomatic utterances are on record\\nmoreover following chomskys logic while the more preferable policies of trump lack evidence by the same token the more objectionable policies of trump also lack evidence for the same reason trump has no political track record upon which to judge what he would do if in the oval office thus following this chomskyian logic one could not pass judgement on hardly of trumps pronouncements would he really build a wall on the mexicous border where is the evidence for this would trump really ban muslims from entering the us where is the evidence for this\\nby effectively undermining trumps peacemongering visàvis clintons warmongering chomsky by the same logic undermines criticisms of the regressivist political utterances by trump thus following chomskys logic through it seems a bit hard to know whether his suggestion is intended seriously\\n the suffering which these and other similarly extremist policies and attitudes will impose on marginalized and already oppressed populations has a high probability of being significantly greater than that which will result from a clinton presidency\\none assumes that chomsky refers to the domestic population here trumps policies  if he is true to his word to protect jobs for american workers and punish offshoring of american jobs along with his opposition to the tpp  would be a political reversal for neoliberalization clintonomics would be decidedly worse for marginalized and oppressed peoples at home and abroad the economic plight of students the poor and ill however would be much better under a jill stein presidency \\nthe economic plight of students the poor and ill would be much better under a jill stein presidency\\nif chomsky is referring to the preponderant violence of us foreign policy and its oppressive and genocidal on populations then i agree with his basic moral principle not only must we take responsibility for our actions but the consequences of our actions for others are a far more important consideration than feeling good about ourselves under the democratic administration hundreds of thousands have died millions of people have been displaced and terrorist organizations have proliferated this is the evidence from clintons time in political office thus a vote for clinton is predictably a vote that will lead to a continuation perhaps even a ramping up of the suffering of others basic morality suggests to this writer to steer clear of casting such an oppressionenabling vote\\n should constitute sufficient basis to voting for clinton where a vote is potentially consequentialnamely in a contested swing state\\ni contend that chomskys basis for  is false or questionable first chomsky has staunchly argued that we should concentrate foremost on the wrongful actions and crimes of our own state because they are something we can have an influence over but it seems that chomsky believes that trump will supersede clintons record of killing in iraq libya and syria clinton is not going to close us military abroad trump has called these bases into question and if one concentrates on the domestic population at least the rhetoric of trump against socalled free trade agreements and offshoring us factories abroad bodes well for the american worker\\n however the left should also recognize that should trump win based on its failure to support clinton it will repeatedly face the accusation based in fact that it lacks concern for those sure to be most victimized by a trump administration\\nthis criticism is antidemocratic furthermore the criticism applies conversely chomskys citing the accusation gives it a veneer of credence effectively it leads to the perpetuation of the businessparty duopoly the records of the bill clinton and barack obama administrations demonstrate the futility of such a proffered rationale clinton deregulated the finance sector exposed american workers to the vagaries of free trade implemented regressive welfare policies and continued aggressive us militarism abroad obama bailing out the banks attempts to cut back social security warring in afghanistan libya yemen and syria drone strikes confrontation with russia and china tpp and the lingering incarceration at guantanamo bay it is important to note that democrats arguably have a freer hand to implement rightist policy than republicans have since many supporters of democrats will mute their opposition to avoid providing succor to the republicans george bush was stymied from tinkering with social security notably obama has done an aboutface on social security and proposed an expansion picking up on the popularity for such a measure from the bernie saunders candidacy\\n often this charge will emanate from establishment operatives who will use it as a bad faith justification for defeating challenges to corporate hegemony either in the democratic party or outside of it they will ensure that it will be widely circulated in mainstream media channels with the result that many of those who would otherwise be sympathetic to a left challenge will find it a convincing reason to maintain their ties with the political establishment rather than breaking with it as they must\\nit is true that establishment operatives will use lev as a bad faith justification for defeating challenges to corporate hegemony either in the democratic party or outside of it that was the case when ralph nader ran it is the case when cynthia mckinney ran and it is when jill stein runs the corporate media and even many socalled progressives will trot out this timeworn argument with each election cycle as long as enough people buy into the premise then the status quo will persist the result is that a rightwing government always assumes office in washington this bodes ill for the poor and working class it bodes poorly for nation states designated as enemy states by the us\\n conclusion by dismissing a lesser evil electoral logic and thereby increasing the potential for clintons defeat the left will undermine what should be at the core of what it claims to be attempting to achieve\\nconclusion by buying into a lesser evil electoral logic the corporatepolitical duopoly will remain in power to continue policies that primarily benefit the  and their goals for further enrichment to unfetter finance to pursue a belligerent foreign policy  a policy that seeks to placate the militaryindustrial establishment and to further entrench corporate domination of the electoral system all of this is at crosshairs with what should be at the core of what progressives claim to be attempting to achieve\\nfinal comments\\nthe tragedy of opting for lesser evilism is that the people get evil\\nsome leftist commentators argue that there is no evilism  i found that to be preposterous barack obama was the socalled lesser evil the previous two election cycles obama is not a lesser evilist he is the man who enables evil  the cycles of usbacked violence and killing in places such as gaza syria bahrain afghanistan yemen and somalia underscore the utter futility of pandering to a perceived lesser evilism if one votes for a degree of evil then one should not be surprised when evil results\\nprogressivism demands that social justice activists repudiate evil morality dictates that people should not live in fear of being killed a genuine peacemongering us president is needed to stop the killing and save lives consequently both democrats and republicans are anathema given the present candidates if people vote then the only conscionable vote is for someone not of the business party factions\\nonly a propeace third party will set the us on a new path  outside of a revolution the election of a propeace third party is the only moral direction on the horizon for americans truly interested in steering their country toward peace and rehabilitating the ensanguined us reputation such a third party vote however may well augur the birth of a revolution on many promising

seen as part and fabric of the establishment and as the most corrupt candidate to run for president in the history of the country\\na president clinton in a few weeks would return us to the hostile climate towards india that we saw in the s overseen by her husband after he took office in  the us relationship with india went on a considerable downslide for nearly a year clinton did not bother appointing an ambassador to india even as he went about opposing india on multiple fronts leading to anger in the indian establishment initially he was intent on disarming and weakening india by preventing access to technology and also mounted a sustained attack on the indian economy by imposing several economic sanctions\\nin  senator joe biden who is now the vice president under barack obama introduced an amendment in the bill granting aid to russia making the aid conditional on the fact that russia could not sell cryogenic engines for indias space programme the clinton administration was hellbent on hurting the development of indias space and technology sectors and blocked the sale of cray supercomputers that had been approved under the ronald reagan administration india was also targeted for several economic sanctions and was threatened under what was called the super  clause of the american trade law\\nthese economic sanctions were specifically borne out in the way mr clinton attacked the indian textile and carpet industries throughout the s the terms dunkel draft super  wto and patent laws became synonyms for the us attempts to retard the indian economy and led to many protests in india\\nby  india was justified in believing that indous relations had hit the lowest point but things took a dramatic turn for the worse during bill clintons second term in office madeleine albright became the new secretary of state and she was increasingly hostile to india especially through her pseudoracist television outbursts in fact she loved attacking india so much she went at it after leaving office and called for a plebiscite in kashmir justifying the actions of violent groups in the process\\nmore clintons policies look like a death sentence for americans  things to expect with a hillary clinton presidency hillary clinton must be indicted how hillary clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital remember this is the same bloodsoaked albright who advocated bombing yugoslavia and then got her investment firm to attempt a takeover of mines in that country like the clintons she also knows how to abuse her power lest we forget albright also justified the deaths of half a million iraqi children and claimed that the deaths were worth it and the icing on the cake for this particularly nasty woman albright has already threatened women in america and claimed that there was a special place in hell reserved for them if they did not vote for hillary clinton\\nthere is already talk of joe biden in the frame as secretary of state under hillary clinton biden would continue his antiindia agenda and try to thwart the development of indias space programme and other technological advancements then of course there is hillarys closest confidante a duplicitous lady called huma abedin who is of pakistani descent and whose family has links to radical elements in pakistan and saudi arabia abedin could end up playing an important role in determining american foreign policy and would be certainly antimodi\\nanother point against hillary clinton is that the hawkish henry kissinger has supports her and her oeuvre as secretary of state this is the same kissinger who is so hostile against india many of his racist statements are even on tape to that end\\nit is in the light of this setting that many indianamericans have opposed the candidacy of hillary clinton and have come out in support of donald trump in contrast to the policies of the clintons trump has promised to make india the best friend of the us and has stated that he looks forward to working with prime minister narendra modi trump has also reached out to hindus in us while there is always a risk of the unknown and it is not clear if trump can make the change he wants to a hillary presidency will certainly be a major step back for india\\nin order for india to build a constructive relationship with us it requires people in both countries to

discovered clinton overpowered in states without paper trails where tampering could never be detected the authors also compared voting machine tallies with exit poll figures and found disturbing discrepancies they concluded these data suggest that election fraud is occurring in the  democratic party presidential primary election this fraud has overwhelmingly benefited secretary clinton at the expense of senator sanders the paper can be found here \\nthen with the primaries concluded a group of outraged patriots with day jobs organized as election justice usa  published an exhaustive report the study is entitled democracy lost a report on the fatally flawed  democratic primaries  and it is available here  it details in  pages of carefully assembled and compelling evidence examples of election fraud uncovered in four categories voter suppression registration tampering illegal voter purging and fraudulent voting machine tallies in eleven states the group found discrepancies between exit polls and voting machine counts exceeding the statistical margins of error every single discrepancy favored secretary clintonand no such discrepancies occurred in the republican counts the groups conclusion was troubling  elected delegates their report argues persuasively were awarded fraudulently to clinton and denied sanders accordingly\\nthat gave her the edge in delegate count going into the convention in the end however she needed the additional votes of  unelected superdelegates those empowered by the democratic national committee even after a primary season documented as fraudulent

inclusion of previously excluded classes of people in the super elite the united states is an oligarchy of the   of the  any president who is not already among the  like bill clinton becomes part of

and the clinton global initiative while hillary was secretary of state just imagine the new depths of corruption that the next eight years and beyond could bring obama has said hes now considering a move from the white house to venture capitalism that has silicon valley slathering at the opportunity\\nevery four years americans are given the illusion of choice between oligarchs andor aspiring oligarchs who will serve the interests of oligarchy candidates who aspire to actually represent the interests of the people are marginalized by the corporate media and the paytoplay campaign contributions of the oligarchs\\nin municipal and county elections and ballot measures americans often do have real choices but the higher and more powerful the office the greater the corruption and oligarchic control nevertheless only a small minority of americans actually vote n local elections the atlantics citylab reporting project recently concluded that fewer than  vote in mayoral elections in  of the  most populous cites disengagement is one of the most fundamental facts of american political life\\nregarding federal elections this concept of democracy within the largest most lethal military power the world has ever seen is bogus to begin with when us citizens cast ballots to elect a new commanderinchief who will continue the project of perpetual war military industrial profits and global hegemony how democratic is that the vast majority of those who will suffer and die dont get to vote the only exceptions are members of the us armed services who die in us wars if those on the other side of the pentagons crosshairs were able to vote im sure they would elect our green party presidential candidate jill stein who said we say to trump we dont need no friggin wall we just need to stop invading other countries her running mate vice presidential candidate ajamu baraka has called the humanitarian interventionist argument a new version of the white mans burden and said you have to ask yourself when was the last time the us has been on the side of the people and the answer is never\\nmore top aide to hillary clinton urges the fbi to disclose what it knows about trumps russia ties what will hillary clinton do for india not much and heres why clintons policies look like a death sentence for americans  things to expect with a hillary clinton presidency how do you explain the dynastic governance clinton is the american dream in all its glory\\nim not sure i can explain the clinton dynasty except to agree that it is one chelsea has been very involved in the clinton foundation and is quite likely to enter political life and even run for president one day we have had other political dynasties most notably the roosevelts the kennedys and the bushes and there are many lower level dynasties like the browns in california jerry brown the current governor of california is the son of former california governor pat brown new york state has the cuomos governor andrew cuomo is the son of former governor mario cuomo and his brother chris cuomo is a prominent corporate television host\\nregarding the american dream i assume youre referring to the dream that if you work hard and play by the rules you can achieve some proportionate degree of status security and prosperity if so the clintons certainly arent living the american dream because although they did well in school theyve hardly played by the rules theyve enriched themselves with that welloiled influence peddling operation i mentioned earlier the clinton foundation and the clinton global initiative were all wondering whether hillary clinton and maybe even bill clinton might finally be indicted now that the fbi has reopened its investigation of clinton email because more of it was discovered on the laptop that anthony weiner  a former congressman under fbi investigation for sex offense  shared with his wife clinton aide huma abedin if hillary clinton is elected shell have to be impeached convicted and removed from office but thats extremely unlikely  no matter whats in the newly discovered email  if her party the democrats win a majority in the house and more than a one third minority in the senate it takes a majority in the house to impeach a president and a twothirds majority in the senate to then convict and remove a president so hillary clinton is at a berlusconi moment in her sordid career her best chance of avoiding indictment is getting elected getting back to the american dream that you can get ahead by working hard and playing by the rules bill clinton was impeached by the house of representatives for perjury and obstruction of justice regarding his affair with a yearold white house intern and his testimony in a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by another former employee however his own party held a majority in the senate and they acquitted him this was all legal according to the us constitution but does it really sound like he was playing by the rules during the final days of his presidency clinton acquitted glencore international founder mark rich an international fugitive who had fled to switzerland his exwife had donated to the democratic national committee the clinton presidential library and hillary clintons new york senate campaign\\naccording to the law president clinton had the authority to acquit rich but how would any rational person consider that anything but bribery and corruption\\nin  clinton polished the reputation of president nursultan nazarbayev kazakhstans autocratic leader and human rights offender who then gave a uranium mining lease to canadian businessman frank giustras shell company making it worth tens of millions of dollars overnight giustra then made a big contribution to the clinton foundation no one has claimed that this was illegal but is it playing by the rules\\nwhen guistra sold a majority stake in his company uranium one to rosatom the russian atomic energy agency it was approved by secretary of state hillary clinton giustra then contributed  million to the clinton foundation and bill clinton was offered a  speaking engagement with a russian investment bank with links to the kremlin does that sound like playing by the rules and now hillarys trying to make us believe that russias meddling in our elections and threatening confrontation with russia over syria i dont think shes kidding about the confrontation but the clinton foundation rarely passes up the chance to make another million dollars or more in any circumstances\\nmeanwhile most of the rest of us are not living the american dream sixtythree percent of americans are living on the edge of financial catastrophe unable to handle a  car repair or a  emergency room bill  the clintons as i said serve the oligarchy they have also managed to join when bill clinton was on his way out in the last months of his presidency he worked with republicans in the lame duck congress to deregulate the banking industry by  its dishonest excessive and abusive financialization scams had crashed the economy costing millions of americans their jobs andor homes then as a new york senator hillary clinton voted to bail out the big banks who committed the crime while many of the rest of us struggled in the crashs wake\\nhow do you explain that candidate clinton who failed as secretary of state with the death of the us ambassador in libya her health problems the scandal of emails is the candidate of the democrats\\nagain clinton serves the interests of the oligarchy that she herself has joined many people believe that the nomination was stolen from bernie sanders the democratic candidate who spoke out against oligarchy growing income inequality and even the israeli lobbys dominance in american politics\\nbut theres one other important element to this americans who identify as liberals supporters of womens rights andor antiracists have such a longstanding allegiance to the democratic party that supporting its nominee every four years is their kneejerk reaction ever escalating foreign wars dont seem to penetrate their consciousness or conscience especially when those wars are waged primarily with drones and proxy armies instead of us troops and once the republicans nominated the openly racist and misogynistic donald trump defeating trump became a liberal crusade\\nthere are of course glimmers of rationality and hope yesterday i was out canvassing for an oakland california ballot measure with a young black man a college sophomore despite trumps overt racism he told me that he considers clinton even more dangerous because he understands that she has essentially promised confrontation with russia over syria he understands that such escalation increases the chance of a nuclear war accidental or not and that trump for all his faults says that the cold war is over that nato is largely obsolete and that clinton is recklessly risking confrontation with russia by promising to remove bashar alassad\\nour green party presidential candidate jill stein is reported to be polling at  among voters under  and much of bernie sanderss support was quite visibly from the same age group local grassroots organizing is also empowering people to create institutions free of oligarchic and corporate control they include community gardens renewable energy buyers cooperatives and gmofree zones if a ballot initiative to make californias sonoma county gmofree passes the whole northwest coast of california will be a gmofree zone from santa cruz to humboldt counties and including one inland county trinity\\ndont you think that the twoheaded american system with the candidates of two traditional parties democratic and republican is out of breath\\ni wouldnt say its out of breath because its still very much in control however trump has left the republican party in disarray with many republican luminaries and funders defecting to clinton who is welcoming them with open arms as black agenda report editor glen ford has written  the clintons have succeeded in assembling under one party roof nearly the whole of the us ruling class and their hordes of attendants and goons the scam that undergirded the duopoly system that has served the lords of capital so well for so long has come undone thanks to a white nationalist billionaire who was too spoiled to play by the corporate rules the two parties of the ruling class have become one\\nits hard to say whether or not the republican party will survive this election or what it will be in another four years if it does\\none possibility could significantly change this if green party presidential candidate dr jill stein wins  in this election the green party will become an official national party eligible for  of the federal funds made available to official national parties to host their presidential nominating conventions and support their nominee this year all federal funds went to the two official national parties republicans and democrats who also have access to huge amounts of plutocratic and corporate money the greens take no corporate money\\nfive percent of the vote and five percent of the federal funding for elections may not sound like much but it would be a huge watershed for the us greens it would be a big psychological and visibility boost and it would mean starting the next presidential campaign year with more than twice the funds that jill steins campaign has been able to raise\\nwinning  would also ensure ballot access for the greens in most states not only in federal elections but also in down ballot races as it is greens are required to spend much of their time and money just gathering enough signatures to satisfy all the byzantine ballot access requirements that vary in each of the  states\\neveryone knows that clinton is the future president of the usa in your opinion why they are facilitated her task and who has interest in seeing clinton in the oval office\\nshe is backed by the oligarchy corporate and dynastic particularly the investment bankers the oil industry and the weapons manufacturers who not only profit but also lobby for foreign wars they are advancing their own interests by promoting a candidate who will serve them liberals have been conditioned to function as unpaid clinton operatives in this election and the corporate media like the cops serve as protectors of the oligarchy and again the majority of americans are politically disengaged\\nyou are close to jill stein head of the green party which emerged late in the campaign why was this alternative sabotaged\\nwell i wouldnt say im close to jill personally but she knows who i am and i of course know who she is ive reported on her campaign and on the us greens for the past year on radio and in print and online outlets and im always honored when she shares those reports on her social media pages i write for the black agenda report and feel politically and intellectually close to its editors who have given their full support to the green party this year even as bernie sanders surged in the polls and many imagined he might actually win the democratic nomination in these times that are so easy to see as the end times shared rationality and humanity are the closest bonds that many of us have regardless of the geographic distance between us\\njills campaign could hardly compete with the republicans and democrats because neither she nor any other greens solicit or accept corporate money we stand behind the slogan people and planet before profits and we call for a halt to the death march led by the weapons manufacturers fossil fuel giants and agrochemical companies who profit from it jill calls for immediately cutting the military budget by half closing all the us military bases in foreign countries and launching a peace offensive she proposes free public education from kindergarten through college the abolition of student debt national health insurance and a green new deal that would reinvest the resources now squandered on weapons manufacture and all the illegal immoral lethal and environmentally catastrophic us wars the green new deal would create a renewable energy infrastructure and sustainable agriculture before its too late to stop the climate meltdown  if it isnt too late already and it would fully employ americans in meaningful dignified and cooperative work for the common good\\nof course that all makes far too much sense and threatens the highly concentrated wealth and power of the deathmarch industries i would not be surprised if there were voter fraud to prevent jill stein and ajamu baraka from winning the  that would make us an official national party\\ni have also seen enormous oligarchic determination to stop greens at the local level in  matt gonzalez the green partys mayoral candidate in san francisco seemed to have a good chance of winning that so alarmed the democratic party that it sent all its best known most powerful names and faces to san francisco to campaign for the democratic candidate they sent hillary and bill they sent jesse jackson they sent many democratic party superstars more than once they seemed to be more concerned about defeating matt gonzalez and the greens in san francisco than they were about defeating george bush and the republicans in the following years presidential election\\none of the founders of the san francisco green party was elected to the city and county board of supervisors twice but when he ran for sheriff an executive office democrats pulled him aside and said they could not allow his election unless he left the greens and joined the democratic party which he did they still got rid of him after his first term with a really ugly campaign but thats another complicated story in itself the city and county of san francisco once had more elected greens than any city or county in the country but many of those that greens worked so hard to elect have since defected to the democratic party for the sake of their political careers\\nis not hillary clinton a danger for humanity\\nhell yes i agree with congolese author and political activist patrick mbeko who said shes more dangerous than isis for all the reasons ive already mentioned her dark alliance with the deathmarch industries and her seeming eagerness to confront russia over syria andor on russias borders in the interest of global hegemony russian uranium deal aside i think that diana johnstone was most likely right when she wrote that her strategic ambition in a nutshell is regime change in russia\\nand i have to mention my friends from the african great lakes region  particularly uganda rwanda burundi and the democratic republic of the congo  which became the killing grounds of the s as the us using african proxies established itself as the dominant power there most of my friends from that part of the world are horrified by the clintons all but certain return to the white house the clintons are deeply committed to the false history of the rwandan war and massacres that was used to justify the first and second congo wars and later the humanitarian interventions in libya syria and iraq if the truth about rwanda and dr congo were known bill clinton would be implicated in mass murder but thats true of every us president in office in my lifetime and probably long before that no ones going to try to refer the most lethal military power in history to an international criminal court with more than symbolic authority\\nyou have many worked on africa how do you explain the french leadership in africa\\nwell im no expert in this but i can say a few things\\nfirst i wouldnt call it leadership id say that france sustains a neocolonial and military presence in africa france was a partner in the destruction of libya in mali niger the central african republic and the democratic republic of congo france is protecting the uranium mines essential to the nuclear power that generates  of its electricity theres no doubt that france was complicit in the assassination of resource nationalist and debt resister president thomas sankara and the installation of president blaise compaoré in burkina faso i dont see any sign that french policy towards burkina or any of its other former colonies is any more benign now despite its resignation to compaorés ouster by a popular movement\\nfrance and the us now appear to be military partners in africa more often than not but during the rwandan war and massacres and the congo wars of the s the us displaced france as the dominant power there\\nhowever a source of ongoing tension between france and the us has been their divergent accounts of the massacres known as the rwandan genocide the us defends rwandan president paul kagames account in which he is the savior who swept in to stop the carnage kagame blames france particularly for operation turquoise in which french troops created a humanitarian corridor for rwandan refugees mostly hutus who were fleeing the advance of kagames rwandan patriotic army this conflict has recently been renewed first with france reopening its investigation of allegations that kagame ordered the assassination of rwanda and burundis hutu presidents juvenal habyarimana and cyprien ntaryamira in  rwanda responded by accusing  french officers of helping to plan and organize genocide in rwanda\\nin  nicholas sarkozy attempted to ease the tension between france and the us and rwanda by accepting the usrwandan account of the massacres he publicly apologized for frances alleged guilt in rwandas tragedy  and shortly thereafter france was rewarded with greater access to dr congos resource riches however alain juppé who was the french prime minister at the time of the rwandan massacres and operation turquoise was having none of that he even left the country during kagames  reconciliaton visit to paris  now juppé seems to be leading sarkozy in the bid for his partys nomination and if he is elected president the history of rwanda and dr congo in the s will be more fiercely contested most of my rwandan friends very much hope that juppé will be elected because he defends the dissident history of what really happened they believe for one that operation turquoise saved many rwandan lives\\nwhile africa is a young continent how do you explain that the countries are often directed by old presidents with several mandates and who dont want lose the power\\nthe old presidents cling to power and the western powers with geostrategic interests enable them because autocrats are easier to corrupt and control than rowdy democrats and resource nationalists who try to represent their own people rwandas kagame and ugandas museveni are two prime examples of autocrats who have proven very useful to the us and other western interests\\nfrance the us and all the rest of the nato nations appear to be united in their determination to topple burundis nkurunziza who has dared to raise an independent head and to favor the east particularly russia in resource extraction contracts i cant explain mugabes hold on power at age  or omar albashirs at  since neither are us aliies youll have to ask africans in those countries to explain that\\nin your opinion is not tribalism a major factor in the destabilization of africa why doesnt africa progress and does it stay in the tribal model\\ni really hesitate to say anything about that because im not african myself and i think western media often use the word tribe as a racial slur that disguises western resource interests at play in african conflicts i recently wrote a piece about the new film a brilliant genocide  and milton allimadi the ugandanborn editor of the black star news told me he loved the piece but asked me to remove the one instance in which id used the word tribe i told him id been hesitant about using that word and was glad to remove it im now reading his book  hearts of darkness how white writers created the racist image of africa \\nwhy are congolese being massacred in beni territory north kivu province  the first question ive asked to try to answer that question is what resources are there in beni the answer is oil timber gold diamonds wolfram coltan and cassiterite beni is a vivid example of the saying everybody wants a piece of congo no one could convince me that the industrial nations hunger for all these riches is not at the heart of these conflicts why are all the deadly ethnic conflicts in dr congos resourcerich eastern provinces\\nthe competition andor animosity between ethnicities or groups is often real as they are in the west but in africa the geostrategic and resource interests of the industrial nations are always in play behind the scenes western powers often exacerbate local rivalries in pursuit of their own interests\\ni sometimes cohost a show called afrobeatradio with my friend wuyi jacobs on wbainew york city and we both hope to someday produce a show about rwanda and burundi in which we wont have to use the words hutu or tutsi dr léopold munyakazi convinced me that these two groups are better understood not as tribes or ethnicities but as social classes in rwandan history that were exaggerated by europeans who have found it convenient to pit one group against the other\\nlibya lives total chaos how do you analyze the situation in libya\\nits horrible like so much else it makes me deeply ashamed to be an american if you read hillary clintons email its easy to see that the usnato war on libya was for one another western war against another defiant resource nationalist muammar gaddafi regardless of whatever human rights offenses gaddafi or saddam hussein were guilty of both were resource nationalists as was mohammed mossadegh the secular democratically elected prime minister of iran who nationalized iranian oil before our cia and the uks m ousted him in the  coup i wrote about how this played out in libya in  clinton email we came we saw we got oil \\nobama says that failing to prepare for the aftermath of the libyan war was the greatest mistake of his presidency but id say his greatest mistake was waging the libyan war in the first place like the iraq war it has created chaos and perpetual war that continues to spread through the middle east and north

which if implemented would weaken the transatlantic stranglehold\\nthere are currently no political parties running in the major european elections with candidates who genuinely represent workers interests but there are some political movements which threaten the corporate powerelite we will mention them below\\nthere are two important geopolitical processes to consider here the first is the eastwest corporate  geopolitical axis america is pulling the european peninsula away from the eurasian continent with the installation of a neonazi regime in kiev washington attempted to recreate an intermarium from the baltic sea to the black sea and down to the eastern mediterranean  driving a permanent wedge between russia and germany\\nin order to facilitate the social transformation of europe into a america minor millions of pilgrims are necessary hence the deployment of coercive engineered migration as a tool to replace class conscious european workers with deracine youths  in some instances educated enough to do the lowpaid work assigned to them and acculturated enough to pose no problem to the powerelite\\nin the new trotskyite language of this imperial order any leader who attempts to stem the tide of globalisation through populist appeals to tradition and national identity is fascist fascist is a loaded term which generally connotes evil in the public mind in each european country there is a readymade army of youths from wealthy families whose job is to don hoddies attack police and scream fascist and racist at workingclass people desperately trying to find a way out of this nightmare these antifa are the modern equivalent to oswald mosleys fascist gangs in the s they represent the same class interests pettybourgeois leftism is the new world orders avantgarde\\na favourite passtime of the antifa mob is throwing stones at police officers one can only gain acceptance in the antifascist gang by showing how much one hates the pigs so police officers from honest workingclass families get burned alive while the antifa mob chants slogans from the spanish civil war such violence is now a regular occurrence in demonstrations the agents provocateurs often receive help from the intelligence services french police are finding it hard to cope with the chaos developing all over french suburbs they complain that they are not sufficiently equipped and do not have the powers necessary to deal with the growing violence from delinquents they have been demonstrating in paris they have been calling for an end to the control of the french police by free masonry exacerbating the problem is the deepseated racism of many police officers who target black youths with spotchecksm  very often without reason\\nthe recent demonstrations by french police in france against poor working conditions and low pay strongly suggests that there is the possibility that the rank and file of the french police could be waking up to the reality that france is government by a criminal gang after the magnanville terrorist attack in june where two police officers were killed a police officer at the funeral of the deceased refused to shake the hand of president hollande and prime minister manuel valls it was a highly significant act of insubordination\\nthe police who in capitalist societies are the guardians of the ruling class are beginning to realise the criminality of the people they are protecting they are perhaps beginning to understand that the role of the state is to impose the dictatorship of one class over another  that of the minority of super wealthy over the labouring masses\\nmany of these dissident police officers are linked to le pens national front a reliable source in french intelligence informed me that the secret services spend more time watching the farright than the socalled far left they see the far right as a real potential danger to the ruling order whereas the far left present no danger but are in fact a key component of ruling class ideology from the arab spring to nuit debout the farleft are the lifeblood of capitalism the potential of a major split between the national and compradore bourgeoise of imperial states for prospects of workingclass gains is something that needs more study\\nwhat should we make of all this in the context of ceta as i have said on numerous occasions the far right in france are and always have been political opportunists who exploit the despair of the masses they serve the interests of the national bourgeoisie but the national front are regularly denounced by the media not for being right wing rather they are dismissed as being closer to the far left the prospect of raising workers salaries nationalisation of key industries and a halt on the importation of cheap labour appeal to workingclass families\\nas i have pointed out before looking at a debate between the trotskyist jeanluc melanchon and marine le pen in  one would have thought that le pen was

talking about an imminent civil war in the bars and cafes of paris one can hear more and more disgruntled french citizens talking about media disinformation the demonisation of russia the homogenisation of thought and the criminality of the ruling class\\nthe scene has never been more propitious to a populist take over of french politics but one should not have illusions about the national front they are following the menacious zionist narrative on the war on terror muslims are the problem the partys vicepresident forian philippot is close to the ultrazionist lawyer gilleswilliam goldnagel a friend of israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu\\nphilippot recently condemned the comments of presidential candidate jean frédéric poisson who said hillary clinton presented the greatest threat for the world as she is in the pay of the zionists poisson was subsequently forced to kneel before the representative council of jewish institutions in france crif where

fifa rules as well as international law governing the status of occupied territory\\nthe pfa has since been unable to push fifa towards any punitive steps against israel instead fifa opted to monitor developments and attempt with little success to negotiate a way out of the impasse palestine is expected to take legal recourse if fifa fails to take more decisive action at its next council meeting in january\\nthe pfas focus since failing to get israel suspended has been on banning six clubs that are based in israeli settlements on the west bank from playing in israeli lower divisions fifa rules stipulate that clubs based in a recognized federations territory cannot play in leagues of another soccer association without the permission of the home federation the pfa rejects the notion of granting permission because it believes that it would legitimize israeli settlements and the occupation\\nmore swedish soccer player sent off for loud fart during match pfa president jibril rajoub suggested that the pfa would take its case to the court of arbitration for sport cas after a sevenhour meeting earlier this month of a fifa committee headed by tokyo sexwale failed to resolve the issue\\nmr sexwale is scheduled to visit israel later this month for a meeting with israeli sports minister miri regev the fifa council is scheduled to discuss the issue at its next meeting in january the pfa is likely to prepare its case for cas but wait with filing it until after the january meeting\\nisrael sees the palestinian demands and threat as strengthening the growing boycott divestment and sanctions movement bds that sees penalization as a means of forcing the jewish state to alter its policies and ultimately withdraw from territory occupied during the  middle east war\\ncondemnation of the israeli occupation and settlements by the united nations security council constitutes the legal basis for the pfas approach as well as potential challenges in international courts\\nthe strength of the palestinian position has been weakened changing persian gulf attitudes towards israel and saudi and united arab emirates pressure on palestine authority president mahmoud abbas persian gulf states despite paying lip service to the palestinian cause have become more public about their informal relations with israel based on common opposition to expanding iranian influence in the region\\nwriting in the kingdoms controlled press a prominent saudi journalist went as far as calling for the establishment of diplomatic relations with israel the uae last year agreed to the opening of an israeli diplomatic mission accredited to the abu dhabibased international renewable energy agency rather than the uae government bahrain as part of an agreement to host next years fifa congress has consented to issue visas to representatives of the ifa israeli nationals are barred from travelling to persian gulf countries\\nat the same time saudi arabia and the uae have been pressuring mr abbas to resolve his differences with mohammed dahlan the controversial former abu dhabibased gaza strongman who is an archenemy of the palestinian president mr dahlan is widely seen as a successor to year old mr abbas who would be acceptable to israel\\nisrael may be able to count on some degree of tacit persian gulf support within fifa but is likely nonetheless to ultimately have to be seen to be accepting some kind of compromise that throws a bone to the palestinians\\nthe palestinians focus on the israeli west bank teams has however raised the bar for israel an agreement between prime minister benyamin netanyahu and former fifa president sepp blatter struck last year addresses many of the pfas grievances but not the issue of six the west bank teams their status goes to the heart of the palestinianisraeli conflict the legal status of territory occupied by israel since \\nunder the agreement mr netanyahu proposed to give palestinian players special identity cards and place sports liaison officials at crossings between palestinian areas and those under israeli control in a bid to eliminate obstacles to free movement that complicated the development of palestinian soccer mr netanyahu further suggested to create an escort service that would facilitate players travel between the west bank and gaza that are separated by israeli territory\\nisrael initially appeared to live up to its promises by granting for the first time in  years a west bank team hebrons al ahli passage to gaza to play a palestine cup final against the strips al shejaia hopes that this signalled a new beginning were however dashed when the pfa cancelled the return match in hebron after israel agreed to grant passage to only  of the  players who were scheduled to travel implementation of the agreement has since evaporated\\nthe pfa by putting the west bank teams at the top of their agenda has made it tougher for fifa and israel to work out a compromise that would not have implications for the future of israelipalestinian peace making israeli is likely to want to avoid subjecting its policies to the scrutiny of an international court yet that may be exactly what would best serve the palestine authoritys overall strategy',\n",

       " ' shares\\n   \\nan important question is on the  election statewide ballot in massachusetts question  deals with the states charter school cap without the cap upwards of  charter schools could be approved by the state district in the next fiscal year the charter school scam has spread its tentacles into the state ofmassachusetts in large part due to the obama administration a vote no is thus critical toward halting the march of privatization in the education system occurring nationwide as massachusetts residents gear up to vote for the next president of the united states it is important to remember that the transformation of public education into a private good will not cease as long as popular opposition fails to confront its roots in washington\\nthe obama administration immediately created the race to the top program after the  election this program paved a direct path toward the elimination of public education as we know it the department of education funneled billions of us dollars into incentive schemes to privatize public schools district by district federal funds were dangled in front of mostly poor mostly black cities as long as these districts met the mandates of the program these mandates included the closure of failing schools mergers with forprofit charter schools and the complete transformation of public schools into charter laboratories race to the top created favorable conditions for private capitalists to engulf the entire us public education system\\nthe results have been disastrous hundreds of public schools have closed around the country tens of thousands of public school teachers have been fired in new orleans nearly every school operating in the district is a privately owned by  publicly funded charter schools the chicago teachers union recently averted a strike but has been dealing with the consequences of the closure of fifty schools in the city in  \\nthe impact of charter schools has extended beyond teacher layoffs and school closures charter schools have also promoted segregation based on race and class the civil rights project of ucla has found that seventy percent of black charter school students attend intensely segregated charter schools  furthermore charter schools also demand an even more intense policy of standardized testing withcurriculums that are often guided by the test corporations themselves all the while these institutions have found ample time to discriminate against els and disabled students\\nin addition charter schools have been found to cheat students from a quality education charter schools are even more militarized than traditional public schools and sport higher rates of suspension and expulsion rates corporate charter operators also cream students from the top and toss the rest even so charters have not proven to do any better than public schools in terms of test scores  what the charter school movement does possess is the backing of the elite which has masterfully used media and nonprofit manipulation to demonize public education\\nthe usual capitalist players have been the primary leaders in the drive to rid of the charter school cap in massachusetts the new york lobbying group families for excellent schools is controlled by hedge fund managers whose funds stem from donations from the walton family ie walmart another organization education reform now advocacy has received upwards of  million dollars from the same source  charter schools are often labeled public because they receive tax payer dollars however the schools are accountable to no one except the corporate interests that back them\\na yes vote on question two would place the education of students in massachusetts firmly in the hands of the kingpins of privatization not only would twelve charter schools per year be subject to approval but fortyfive public schools would be in danger of closure over  million more dollars per year would be siphoned from public schools across the state at the moment the charter school cap allows the state to operate no more than  charter schools if the cap islifted however this restriction would no longer apply and leave the students families and educatorsvictimto the shock and awe privatization which has characterized national policy for over two decades\\nopposition to privatization is being led by the organization save our schools save our schools consists of families teachers students and unions that are looking to prevent an era of unbridled privatization in the massachusetts public education system charter schools already drain  million from public education in the stateeach year as it currently stands a vote no would protect public schools and thus the unions that representtheir educators\\na no vote would build upon numerous labor victories in the massachusetts area over the last few years the boston school bus drivers union local  won a historic victory against the veolia corporation in  the harvard dining workers of local  unite here followed by defeating harvards bid to raise healthcare costs in october of  now it is time to stand with teachers across the state in their effort to prevent fullscale privatization\\ndoing so will not be easy the model of unionmanagement cooperationwith thedemocratic party continues to prevent workers in massachusetts and across the country from taking offensive action against the privatization assault a vote no on question  in massachusetts would show that community and union members can organize a successful pushback against the forces behind privatization however a vision of transformation and radical change must be articulated if defense of public education is to materialize into a peoples movement the fight against privatization must be placed in the contextof the larger struggle to build a world that working and oppressed people would vote yes to',\n",

however bnai brith is not just a special interest group it is perhaps the most vindictive organization that has ever received prominence in the west allow me to elaborate\\nyou have correctly identified bnai brith to be behind this movement against shutting down free speech while this statement is accurate this phenomenon of targeting canadian universities and canadian society is not something that started now not too long ago it used to be branded as the hidden hand behind the hidden hand during the harper era this operation became a fullblown politically driven policy directive the legislation that dr mahon pathetically relies upon is a product of the harper era harper had an extremist rightwing background and organizations like bnai brith have channelled that extremism to accomplish their hateful agenda as early as the s i personally observed the spirit of this unholy union during my tenure as the president of muslim student association at the university of alberta although harper didnt attend that university we were not too far from the epicentre of the neoconservatism movement that was brewing in canada we fastforward  years and come upon the type of events such as professor hall travesty that are products of that time in fact a web of such operations has been in full force for sometime in every aspect of canadian lives only recently we had this court ruling against canadian security intelligence service that was illegally spying on the public this gangsterlike involvement started in  shortly after harper and the neocon came to power\\nthis is not to say that the public is protected from such unconscionable manoeuvring under a liberal government in fact the most notorious scandals involving government and human rights have erupted during the liberal regime take for instance the case of omar khadr travesty \\nmore creating an antimuslim bias at a canadian university suspension of tenured professor lacks due diligence toxic mind control contaminates the public sphere irish human rights activists against freedom of speech this case is something we had known albeit too late to intervene at the time and has been subsequently discredited publicly even during the harper regime  the overwhelming theme was pointed out by then barely  year old omar khadr who said  you dont care about me  this is what defines the mindset of these people bent on extremism over extremism to subdue public conscience\\nthe attack on professor hall was particularly toxic but equally sinister attacks have taken place before some decade ago now defunct canadian islamic congress faced onslaught from all sides based on planted stories and baited manoeuvring it was the largest muslim organization at a time canadian muslims became the largest religious minority one particular episode involved bnai briths planted story involving a university professor who became the target of hate crime while at the same time investigated for hate crime if it wasnt for the humane and civic behaviour of the then university president current governor general david johnston it would have become career threatening if not life threatening event of the professor top university personnel told me in private how the university faced pressure from donors that wanted that professor to disappear from the academic as well as public arena the vendetta of this sort beggars belief even today what we dont know is how many of these assaults on conscience took place and has been brewing\\nclearly some of the faithful memberssympathizers apply it publicly such was the case of former professor turned politician irwin cotler who routinely infected the political arena with his prejudice and bias imported from the academia then there are others such as alan rock of university of ottawa that implanted manoeuvring of the political arena to the academia a third group would be lorna marsden of york university that abused authority to run a vindictive agenda yet others have found every other way possible to target a person of conscience all the meanwhile covering up all trails so the victim cannot point a finger to the attacker and has no recourse to justice or self defence it doesnt matter which category they belong to they all produce scandals and drag down the good name of the academia while agencies that are supposed to be uphold the rights and dignity of the academia stand by and for some cases join in to the atrocity this obscene attack on human rights and academic decency was once brought to light by late professor david noble who ended up suing york university and canadian jewish congress jointly for conspiring against him professor noble a jew himself faced the vilest of subjugation by organizations claiming to promote the rights of jews that wasnt enough dr noble had to take on human rights commission and other agencies that stood by either in complicity or in collusion with the university authority professor noble passed away before the lawsuit could see a day in court but soon university of ottawa would come in the picture with the infamous involvement of alan rock a man without a phd that was at the helm of the university mr rock recently left the universitybut not before leaving the universitys good name in the sewerage of politicking what dr mahon has done is bring this insidious modus operandi to yet another victim\\nhad i not have the misfortune of being on the wrong side of this modus operandi in the last  years i would almost not understand what is at works here in old days such tactic would be unheardof in a university certainly such things couldnt happen in a civilized country i would exclaim\\nso what happened to professor hall is not new what is new is the waking up of the general public your letter reverberates the emotion of everyone with conscience that came to know about professor hall people are waking up and are beginning to ask for justice for instance in the context of csis an activist jim comeau wrote i would say its time to jail the highest ranking csis to send a clear message to the rest of them do something illegal straight to prison they damn well knew what they were doing was illegal\\nthe peoples revulsion to such atrocious maligning of people of conscience was summed up in recent letter of julian assange who wrote on us general election day november  \\nyet some weeks ago in a tactic reminiscent of senator mccarthy and the red scare wikileaks green party candidate stein glenn greenwald and clintons main opponent were painted with a broad red brush the clinton campaign when they were not spreading obvious untruths pointed to unnamed sources or to speculative and vague statements from the intelligence community to suggest a nefarious allegiance with russia the campaign was unable to invoke evidence about our publicationsbecause none exists\\nin the end those who have attempted to malign our groundbreaking work over the past four months seek to inhibit public understanding perhaps because it is embarrassing to them  a reason for censorship the first amendment cannot tolerate only unsuccessfully do they try to claim that our publications are inaccurate\\nof course recent events have allowed us to see this in the highest level of politics in the united states\\nto anyone with an iota of conscience there is no mystery here people are making their voice clearly known in the words of claire lanyado i prefer unpredictable to criminal and evil the problem is when a president of university for whatever reason decides to use his position to serve the special interest group deliberately there is no recourse for a professor to fight himher in other cases if such atrocity were launched against a student eg the case of freemanmaloy vs lorna marsden of york university  the student an antizionist jew could bring a lawsuit of misfeasance in public office with the help of yet another jewish lawyer peter rosenthal who himself is a university professor of mathematics it was struck down by the court and then it was overruled by the court of appeals at the end the university settled and dr marsden the embattled president was gone the morale of this story is the path to justice is steep but for a professor the path to justice is becoming impossible\\nthe irony is that it is the people harboring so much hate who tell others that they are committing hate crimes just because they dare speak out against an atrocity of course they pick their targets that are perceived as weak and vulnerable and they attack the target only after making sure that the target cannot run to anyone for justice\\nthats how extremism works\\n sincerely\\nrafiq islam',\n",

       " 'part  introduction  shares\\n   \\nfor the last  years i have witnessed and experienced the severe restraints on any free and balanced discussion of the facts this reluctance to criticize any policies of the israeli government is because of the extraordinary lobbying efforts of the americanisrael political action committee and the absence of any significant contrary voices\\n former us president jimmy carter \\nhow the interviews came about\\nthe marxian thesis that the dominant culture and ideology of a society here referred to as social base or just base are those of the dominant class here referred to as system is a sharp tool to probe how political systems work and how they stay in power does this tool work in the us model certainly  the relation between the system and its social base has been regular since the inception of the thirteen colonies because of that sustained regularity system and base acted in convergent patterns of dependency in historical perspective it was not possible for the system to transform those colonies into states and thereafter expand its conquests to form a continental empire without a solid social base that shared its purpose and visions for expansion from that time onward an ideological symbiosis ran between the system and the base not only that but each time the system modifies direction philosophy or ideology the base would adapt by modifying its attitudes and perception\\nthe patterns of ideological association between the us system and its social base extended into modern times and the yardstick to measure them is the presidential elections if you look at voters turnout since   you will notice that a relativetolarge majority of americans had voted in those elections my interpretation of the vote in relation to marxs thesis is the following voting for a system that is known for its aggressive imperialist policies crimes around the world overthrowing foreign governments not in line with washington and countless military interventions and invasions that left millions of people dead means one thing voting for that system while knowing its attributes policies and actions amounts to active sharing in its ideology culture and violence\\nmore zionism is racism zionism goes from bad to worse taking judaism with it how modern is israel green party of canada calls to revoke jewish national fund charitable status caveat that does not necessarily mean that all voters share the systems imperialistic values of violence and destruction of foreign peoples the pertinent meaning of voting interpreted in relation to the systems foreign policy objectives versus the objectives of the base resides in two concepts discarding immediately the notion that the base has been cohabitated by the system the first concept has it that the base has given a mandate to the system to carry out its ideology of empire and imperialism based on the undeclared condition to spare the people from the horrors of foreign wars a dichotomy sets in here the system has its way of life and the base has its own the second concept has to do with the basic tenets of colonialism meaning if the system could be successful to obtain unspecified benefits through wars then the base could share in these benefits despite aversion to violence and opposition to the institution of war as a means to resolve problems between nations\\n a question would abstaining from voting resolve the issue of active sharing in the policies of the system this subject is open for debate   \\nthe relation between the american system and its base was uniform up to a certain point in history late s until that point the american state was still busy completing its structural transformation into a big power status that uniformity however managed to keep the patterns of the political power unchanged to be exact despite persistent immigration that should have altered the relations between the base and government as well as the composition of the latter the dominance of the traditional ruling elites was  not open for challenge and  shaped by an exclusive american anglosaxon experience\\nbut when franklyn d roosevelt showed signs of surrender to the zionist pressure on the issue of establishing a jewish state in palestine he opened a large crack in the system that was the first time in us history where the powerful american imperialist state yielded to a foreign ideology that was not part of its basic project with that a movement with a limited religious social base began penetrating the files and ranks of the us power the rest is history as a result the unrelenting entrenchment inside the political structures of the united states coupled with accumulated changes in the configuration of the us power the dominant american system itself fell under the domination of one of its social factionsamerican jewish zionists\\nwhen franklyn d roosevelt showed signs of surrender to the zionist pressure on the issue of establishing a jewish state in palestine he opened a large crack in the system\\nas a group american jewish zionists have all attributes of an independent establishment they possess efficient organizational structures have a monolithic political presence across the american system and they know how to finance their activities with us tax money i must note that their alignment with the global agenda of us imperialism is a twopoint expedient the first is focused on being recognized as earnest operators at the service of americas interests the second is tactical to reap on behalf of israel the benefits of alignment with slogans such as israel is our only trusted ally in the middle east\\nthe american jewish zionist experience is agenda driven as such their domestic and foreign agendas have precedence over any other jewishrelated consideration\\non the domestic front the focus could not be more evident to consolidate zionism and turn it into a means to  perpetuate israel as an american national issue and  make of them the principal factor in defining american politics you can notice the endeavor clearly during us elections when the zionist media question whether this or that candidate is good for the jews and for israel today voicing dissent against the policies of american jewish zionism or criticizing israel amounts to crime jimmy carter experienced this firsthand when he published his book palestine peace not apartheid  american jewish zionists unleashed the fire of hell upon him\\nas for the jewish zionist foreign agenda this is clearcut and leaves no space for misunderstanding it aims to induce control or lead the united states to  adopt hostile policies toward the arab nations because due to their rejection of the zionist state and  undertake military actions against any country that appears as posing a potential or direct threat to israel equally important it demands that the united states keep denying the palestinians rights for nationhood through american diplomacy what is the rationale recognition of the palestinian national rights means the invalidation of the zionist state and its claim on palestine\\nbecause the jewish zionist control of the us system is real and dominant how does the american society figure visàvis this dominance based on observations of the american society and its multiple cultural and ideological patterns there can be but one answer zionism is not the dominant culture and ideology of the american people it is however the dominant culture and ideology of the us political system\\nobservations\\nfirst despite gargantuan zionist propaganda apparatuses directed to the american people jewish zionists have consistently failed to create interest or sympathy for zionist issues and for israel\\nsecond due to historically developed indifference to foreign issues a majority of americans have only vague ideas on what zionism is\\nthird to establish roots for their political dominance jewish zionist activists invariably focus not on the american people but on ways to control the american system from inside by controlling first the institutions that matter white house and congress\\nfourth this control did not happen because of elections it is preponderantly due to the practice of appointing jewish zionists to important positions inside the administrations\\nfifth among the stratagems employed by zionists when they run for elective offices one was particularly effective take advantage of the reverence of the population for the idea of election to do that jewish zionist candidates rarely if ever talk about israel or zionism instead they only debate matters of interest to the voters once elected though promoting israel via american legislations becomes the top hidden agenda\\nsixth and to conclude this particular argument the fact that one administration after another succumbed to the diktat of jewish zionists thus indirectly to israel in matters of foreign policy and wars proves that the culture and praxis of those administrations are those of the dominant ideology and culturezionism\\nanother point to discuss is the expansion of the jewish zionist power by all accounts such an expansion is not a phenomenon but an incremental process in his book the arabists the romance of an american elite  robert d kaplan defined the issue that i framed as a process in terms of gradual replacement of traditional diplomatic elites with new ideological elites that had no interest in the ways of the old school of diplomacy kaplan was unambiguous he called these new elites by their names irishamericans and jewishamericans\\nkaplans viewpoint on this replacement is important to our discussion he argued that the old elites approached the usarab relations with an open mind and readiness for dialog all while keeping an eye on the us imperialist interests his argument opens the door for a veritable conclusion the two groups of postwwii american society that kaplan mentioned had in fact changed the dynamics of us foreign policy it is public knowledge that both groups are known for their hostility toward arabs and muslimseach for his own set of religious political and ideological rationales as for the successive shares of africanamericans and hispanics in the making of the national policy of the united states this is another argument\\nas a witness to history in early  i began drafting a comprehensive analysis on the role of american jewish zionists in the making of us policies and wars in the arab world in may of that year as my work became broad in scope i decided to seek more views on the subject i came up with the idea to conduct several interviews where i pose the same questions while some of the prospective interviewees declined and others accepted but then withdrew three prominent thinkers acclaimed for their knowledge scholarship and outstanding political activism graciously gave me their views\\nthey are francis boyle a professor of international law university of illinois college of law james petras a professor emeritus university of binghamton new york canadian writer and former coeditor of the online publication of dissident voice kim petersen professors boyle and petras answered my questions via phone conversations and petersen via email correspondence\\nhowever in the weeks following the interviews my work swelled up to such a length that it became unsuitable for internet publishing in short i was unable to honor my commitment to publish the interviews as planned today as i thank prof francis boyle prof james petras and kim petersen for sharing their invaluable insight i apologize to them for the delay in putting the interviews out there to read\\nintroduction\\nthe turning point in the emergence of jewish zionism as a dominant american political force came about when iraq invaded kuwait discussing the origins and strategic complications of that invasion goes beyond the scope of this introduction the jewish zionist establishment seized the occasion mobilized its omnipresent propaganda operatives and led colossal media campaigns to promote military actions against iraq to bring their war mania to fruition they unleashed their experts in all directions they talked about iraqs formidable military capabilities and about saddams onemillionman standing army ready to invade saudi arabia and seize its oil they told stories about saddam husseins personal life his bunkers and his mortal nuclear threats to israel and they talked about iraqs threats to us interests and allies in the middle east    here is a brief account of those events\\non july   iraqi president saddam hussein met with us ambassador to iraq april glaspie it is on record that glaspie gave hussein an unambiguous but indirect greenlight to resolve iraqs problems with kuwait militarily on august  iraq invaded kuwait on august  george h w bush ordered the freezing of iraqi and kuwaiti assets and immediately placed iraq under hermetic embargo considering the prompt extraordinary antiiraq measures that the united states took in the first  hours of that invasion one wonders what was pushing the us to move so quickly on iraq knowing that only two days earlier this was conducting a us proxy against iran the observation that the us did not take similar actions when iraq invaded iran in  or when israel invaded lebanon in  raises many questions what were the us rationales in taking such measures who conceived them did the us entrap iraq why   \\nthe atmosphere that followed the invasion was surrealistic like a lightning bolt us imperialist and zionist forces instantly mobilized their media talking heads retired generals and bogus experts on the middle east the deafening uproar they made and all lies they told about atrocities committed by iraq in kuwait hid a definite scheme incite for war  in the period august    january   israelis and jewish zionists from all fields appeared en mass and in every possible medium available to urge the bush regime to give up diplomacy in favor of war on january   a member coalition in which the us had the lion shareninetyseven percent of the total forceattacked iraq by every standard and minutia of details the war on iraq in  was an american war \\nat the end of a war that destroyed one of israels arab adversaries george h w bush might have thought of himself as americas laureate hero he did not predict though that his temporary freezing of the us loan guaranties to israel would have unleashed the jewish zionist establishment against him the fact that he lost to bill clinton who opposed bushs freeze and who stated that israel was the only country that paid back its debts indicated that american jewish zionists had finally reached their objective to perfect ways to control the us politics from the inside  in retrospect it can be said that george h w bush was the last nonzionist american president from bill clinton forward us presidents and their vice president became pawns in the jewish zionist play of power\\nnow as the united states was preparing for war with iraq to liberate kuwait thousands of antiwar activists and intellectuals from a wide spectrum of political convictions spoke loudly against it but no one could have ever beaten patrick j buchanans memorable words about how american jewish zionists and israel were pushing for that war he said there are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the middle east  the israeli defense ministry and its amen corner   with that buchanan hit the proverbial nail on the head am rosenthal a ringleader of us zionist journalism could not bear what he heard in a rebuttal he unleashed an acerbic attack against buchanan his weapon of argument so to speak was the stale and trite accusation of antisemitism\\nwhining rosenthal twisted buchanans clear words and went on to imply that buchanan was in effect engaging in an antijewish tirade he reinterpreted buchanans words and cast them in a standard zionistic fashion he wrote that buchanans intention was the jews are trying to drag us into war only jews want war israeli jews want war to save israels hide american jews who talk of military action against iraq want war because it would suit israeli interests they are willing to spill american blood for israeli interests \\nby inserting the word jew in his reply rosenthal and the new york times behind him spat on the face of us political reality under the tight grip of zionism we need not waste our breath on rosenthals petty tactic his clear objective was to distract from the central issue which is buchanans opposition to the planned war against iraq was unrelated to the religious denomination of those who were promoting it rather he was unmistakably referring to their political identity\\nstill buchanan was honest he pointed the finger to israel and its amen corner because that was the truth the fact that most israelis and amen corners happened to be of jewish faith was nonissue to conclude it is evident that buchanan a dreamer of an american republic not empire could not stand by idle while seeing the united states sheepishly fastened to the yoke of zionism and gutlessly prostrating before a tiny settler state israel\\nbuchanan did not stop there truthful and resolute he dared to describe in categorical terms the pitiful condition of the us congress visàvis israel and american jewish zionists he dubbed it as an israelioccupied territory  buchanan powerfully hit the target in such a way that countless cowardly american politicians would dare not think let alone say notice that buchanan had placed israel before its us amen corner i view this as a statement he clearly implied that israel is the primary decision maker did that also imply that us zionist groups amen corner are puppets moved by israel most likely if so which has more power in setting the us world agenda and policies israel or american jewish zionists dialectically the answer should be israel by means of its amen corner\\nnow in december  jim lehrer a former coanchor of the macneillehrer newshour and later sole anchor of the newshour with jim lehrer  interviewed pat buchanan it is important to mention that jim lehrer has monopolized a significant position funded by federal tax money for over  years starting in  is that an issue yes and to debate it the following applies whenever a specific group of people be they christian muslim jewish atheist duopoly party apparatchiks etc keeps an important public post for such a long duration the implication is unescapable the group controls that post because of its embedded importance    but more important they have the power to keep it\\nnonetheless when a specific group continues to hold throughout time important positions inside public corporations agencies and branches of the us government a paradigm emerges either the group controls said corporations directlythat is why it is able to do what they want or it controls them indirectly by controlling first who appoints the board of trustees and sets corporate policies and appointees at any rate considering this type of control the assumption that such group has power over the government and its public corporations is reasonable\\nadditionally the issue of monopoly of news is critical in another respect it means that someone within the context of us imperialism has decided that the us public discourse must conform to predetermined patterns in these patterns issues such as israel zionism palestine us imperialism in the middle east wars etc are designed to move only on linear grounds without ever touching the core of the matter\\nbefore continuing i must state that lehrers political views are not a subject to discuss visàvis his program for one the newshour program is not about the personal views of presentersit is about information prepared for the public from a public corporation second whether lehrer had sympathies for israel or zionism is nonissue because most viewers expect neutral discussions regardless of who delivers them nevertheless a situation such as this has a consequence affecting the special relations between the narrated newscomments the people who deliver them and the people who hear them\\nfirstly planning news delivery to attain specific results is a good technique for those in the business of indoctrination psychology and perception are the areas of expertise that news planners depend on to disseminate certain news and analyses to be sure these planners know that most viewers have no special or personal stakes on events happening in other countries still the immediate consequence that controlled news and commentaries could generate is easy to predict they also know they can seep to the viewers preconceived ideas through pleasant dialogs affable manners appearance of neutrality and clever circumlocutions\\nto be fair to lehrer he was consistent in making intelligent questions however he was also consistent at doing something else he would calibrate his questions in such a way as not to reveal new truths or solicit critical replies that could go beyond boundaries deliberately conceived so as not to be crossed it is pragmatic to say that the observance of these boundaries would nicely serve the zionist and imperialist discourse in essence a practice thusly followed is a preemptive mechanism of control cloaked as a professional presentation\\nnow in his interview lehrer played dumb when he asked buchanan about his bold characterization of the congress he phrased his question as follows you have also said that congress is an israelioccupied territory now what do you mean by that  italics are mine\\ncomment semantically as much as politically buchanans figure of speech was terse and unequivocal he plainly meant that the congress observes israels agenda and acts accordingly there was no need for buchanan to say anything further because what he said had and still has basis in verifiable facts with a question such as what do you mean by that lehrer was not seeking a rational reply from buchanan the form and content of the question had the objective of wanting to entrap buchanan make him retract or at least contradict himself to show inconsistency in essence lehrer had simply tried to deny that israel controls the congress through its amen corner because his what do you mean indicated astonishment rather than request for explanation \\nto wrap up the issue without exclusion any denial of the jewish zionist control of the united states is a farce take abraham h foxman of the infamous antidefamation league as an example foxman authored a masterdeceptive propaganda book that he called  the deadliest lies  the israeli lobby and the myth of jewish control italics are mine first foxman lied he knew very well that the jewish zionist control is not a myth but a pervasive reality second but most important the problem is not the abstract jewish control but the specificjewish zionist control this can be explained using a current universal truth hundreds of thousands of jews from all nationalities actively oppose zionism on political religious ethical historical and ideological grounds\\nfoxmans denial means one of two things either he is a parochial charlatan when the subject is the undisputed power of american jewish zionism or he is very ignorant of the history of zionism  which is impossible either way foxmans business is propaganda demagogy and deception incidentally foxmans denial looks very similar to what some arabs do in the middle east villagersbut even some city folkstry to fend off envy by following an eonold superstition they fix a drawing on a wall in their shops or homes showing the palm of an open hand with an open eye in its center it appears that foxman and his associates have their own superstition by decrying the deadliest lies against american jewish zionists they try to fend off the accusation or the envy that jewsspecifically jewish zionistshave power and influence\\nof substance did foxman not learn or did anyone inform him about what john foster dulles told william knowland a prozionist senator from california back in february  in an exchange about the proposed sanctions to get israel out of egyptian territory occupied by israel in the suez war dulles pronounced these prophetic words we cannot have all our policies made in jerusalem     that was in  today all those who deride or deny the charge that israel has a say on us foreign policy and wars in the middle east must prove that those who are making this charge are misinformed or just lying\\ninterestingly years after buchanan made that statement the successive events proved his sharp assessment and political perspicacity two people vindicated his characterization of capitol hills as an israelioccupied territory and both used his words to make the point the first is a former cia officer philip giraldi and the second is philip weiss founder of mondoweiss website in an article he wrote in  giraldi pointed to the congress as  its still occupied territory  weiss titled a piece he wrote in  as such  capitol hill  still israelioccupied territory \\nat this point do american jewish zionists control the united states do they control it as polity or only the political system do they have real influence in setting us foreign policy and wars against the arab and muslim nations or maybe all this talk is no more than baseless allegations\\nnext\\npart  discussion\\npart  interview with francis boyle\\npart  interview

department of homeland security\\ndownward pressure on wages and working conditions forced my father to refinance our home multiple times to pay college expenses for my sister and i even then my sister and i graduated with large sums of student debt i have worked four jobs in three years and only one has paid a truly living wage another four years of a democratic party president was not going to make anything better for my family that is not to say that donald trump was the answer to the structural problems of exploitation but trumps victory is not the end of the world either\\ntrumps victory is the product of global capitalisms decay millions of people voted for trump for a variety of reasons namely because he clearly labeled problems and outlined solutions to them i dont agree with all of his solutions white nationalism stains his domestic and international agenda trumps call to further militarize the usmexico border yet make peace with russia is a contradiction in and of itself a white nationalist billionaire who speaks the language of racism on the one hand and the interests of peace on the other is not exactly a model of consistency\\nhowever trumps consistency is not the most important aspect of this election millions of people have shown their disgust with the twoparty system of the capitalist class a number of mostly white workers and whites from the petty business class voted for trump trump also received more votes than expected from the black and latino electorate meanwhile the elections produced a low turnout for clinton from the historic democratic party bases of black voters latino voters and women voters clinton may have won the electoral vote but the balance of forces ensured the ruling class would gamble on trump trumps base of white workers and petty business elites angered by thirty years of monopoly capitalist assault are more of a threat at the moment than the millions of democratic party voters who are now without a home the round table of elites called the electoral college could not afford any more damage to the democratic party than what transpired during the election\\nso the democratic party is now on its deathbed and there is only one class of people willing to resurrect it white liberals a large section of the democratic party base wanted bernie sanders to be their next president they did not hold their nose for clinton the legitimate concerns that immigrants and oppressed people possess with trumps racism should not be led into the bowels of the democratic party yet for white liberals this is the ultimate mission\\nmore brian cloughley the greatest achievement of mr trump would be engage in positive discussions with russia and china arise president trump or why its not the end of the world as we know it trumps sexual predator characteristics  his grandfather was a pimp but at least he paid the women he hired the significance of the gops attempted purge of donald trump trumps victory has energized the white liberal section of the united states to fight back white liberals began the process in a deep state of mourning over clintons loss they then placed blame for trumps victory on russia lowvoter turnout and the white working class white liberals have blamed everyone except hillary clinton and the democratic party now white liberals in the us hope to wage a crusade against trump in hopes of a democratic party recovery it is all too clear that their primary intention is to get ahead of the genuine forces that rejected both trump and clinton and lead them into the democratic party graveyard\\nwhite liberals love to hide their own racism and ruling class sensibilities through a process of appeal and betrayal they speak with the authority of moral righteousness on the one hand and the knife of oppression on the other they talk down to the struggle of peoples oppressed by white supremacy and attempt to steer it in a way that benefits their class interests white liberals despise the working class because they understand that there will come a day when it destroys the system that they profit so handsomely from\\nwhite liberals usually originate from the ruling class the managerial class and various stripes of the professionalized sector their class has ordained themselves the true leaders of human rights based on race gender and sexual equality however white liberals speak of human rights on the basis of a complete abandonment of the material struggle for liberation in other words the white liberal is the ultimate counterrevolutionary force in us society it has wielded the socalled struggle for human rights as a weapon to prevent the emergence of classconsciousness among the oppressed and its genuine leaders\\nthe  elections have shown that the broad class arrangement of white liberals is indeed in crisis and only has itself to blame white liberals cannot acknowledge that it was their brand of politics that led to the trump moment their dominance over the left in the us ensured that no organized force existed strong enough to challenge the ills of capitalist decline millions of people voted for sanders based on his demands for material relief millions of people voted for trump for the similar reasons his racism and sexism notwithstanding whatever racism and sexism existed in his rhetoric could not trump the fact that the trade deals and wars he spoke out against in part drove ordinary people to vote for him if the trump base wanted racism and sexism primarily they would of voted for ted cruz or jeb bush in the primaries\\nso white liberal anger about trumps victory is not directed at sexism racism or any other aspect of trumps politics white liberals are afraid of the sharpening contradictions of us society that threaten to squeeze them out of their privileged position under the racist and capitalist order millions of people are now asking where white liberalism was during the massive loss in working class income and wealth that occurred over the last forty years where were the white liberals during the endless wars that have been waged even more fervently by democratic party administrations where were the white liberals during the erection of the largest police and prison state in the world the institutions that murder and incarcerate black americans in record numbers and deport undocumented peoples at historic rates\\nthe answer is that white liberals were supporting the us capitalist systems assault on the oppressed every step of the way this is what they are trying to hide with their anger over trump we cannot defeat trumps white nationalism if the white liberal is not defeated with just as much vigor white liberal ideology has a history of infecting social movements as it spreads it breeds the germs of democratic party control over these movements but the democratic party made its own bed by acting as the more effective evil of the ruling class if a powerful movement of the working class is to emerge in the age of trump then we must fight hard against the white liberal forces working hard to resuscitate the democratic party and build an independent party of our own',\n",

islam\\n publisher new york nova science publishers\\n isbn \\n at a time of politics of fear jaan islam counters fear with knowledge in his masterpiece true islam jihad and terrorism nova science publishers new york  during the  us election it has become clear world peace and security is connected to the state of islam and how it is understood in todays context this is a very timely book that fills a gap in the western society about islamic history philosophy and political science this book presents the islamic political philosophy as represented in the writings of great muslim thinkers and scholars such as ibn khaldun jaan islam uses the socalled islamic cognition technique and starts the book with a chapter dedicated to islamic cognition this chapter on cognition itself is a paradigm shift in the modern research scholarship and can be considered for advancing knowledge in other fields such an extension was first pointed by islam zatzman and islam  in their groundbreaking work on educational curriculum\\nmore stop using millenary religions as a scapegoat for the crimes of modern imperialism another ramadan for muslims amid sufferings a conversation on equality integration and islam as a religious marker an open letter to young muslims everywhere the seed of triumph in every adversity following the tradition of early islamic scholars jaan islam presented all theories in the book with evidence from the primary islamic sources quran and authenticated traditions of the prophet  these sources were completely ignored in the in the orientalist now it has morphed into neoorientalism writings which led to the inundation of the post  world with disinformation and agendadriven research about islamic history the distinction between this book and these agendadriven ones gives the book a special value\\n although the book explains the islamic foundations of political science and governance it should not be looked at as a book of theology it is a dogmafree approach that has been characterized as truly scientific elsewhere  quite appropriately the author starts off with a brilliant narration of islamic cognition it has been all but forgotten in the west that islam is the religion that started the tradition of dogmafree truly scientific cognition the west does recognize averröes the famous islamic scholar as the father of secular philosophy whereas brands islam as just another religion similar to christianity infected with doctrinal philosophy it is no surprise that with that starting point islam remains the most misunderstood religion in the west\\nchapter  of the book deals with fundamental philosophies of three major philosophers namely hobbes locke and ibn khaldun in this chapter the author debunks another myth that is ibn khalduns political theory is somehow similar to those of hobbes and locke ibn khaldun the father of social science indeed had a very different starting point in his cognition the author points out how ibn khalduns first premise was shahadah that formed the basis of the cognition axis by using quran as the origin and prophet muhammads life through the book of hadith as the pivotal point one the other hand locke had placed himself as the pivotal point whereas hobbes eliminated any cognition point the author makes it clear that both hobbes and lockes cognition tools are just as illogical as dogmatic cognition in my researched opinion this accurate distinction has not been made by any other author on the topic it is because the eastern authors do not know about hobbes and locke and the western authors do not know about islamic cognition that was obviously alive and well with ibn khaldun\\nin chapter  the author uses the case laws of the prophet and his four rightly guided caliphs known as rashedun caliphs clearly the authors intention is to understand how the prophet and his closest followers went to war or which verses of the quran they were enacting for the first time anyone took this approach and not surprisingly the author comes up with four rigid criteria from the quran no other author to the best of my knowledge connected them to specific wars that the prophet and his companions engaged in this finding helps the author establish jus ad bellum that can explain every war that shaped the foundation of the young islamic state of the time\\nsimilar to chapter  the author discovers jus ad bello in islamic jurisprudence in chapter  once again the case laws are presented and analyzed in such a manner one can take any new example and evaluate it to call it permissible or not the theoretical basis for critiquing any modern warfare is set in this chapter\\nin chapter  the author addresses a difficult topic when is it allowed or even mandatory to rebel against a head of state it is often stated that islam is a complete code of life the author makes it clear that islam didnt leave anything to imagination and has left a strict criterion and modus operandi for any imaginable crisis that can occur at any time the important question arises as to when a head of state that once claimed to have divine authority can be removed or when a head of state can be declared unfit and it becomes mandatory for the citizens to remove him or wage war if necessary this is not an easy topic to cover even in todays world the author covers it with dexterity from an epoch he considers as exemplary the history is not pretty and there is room for controversy as often the history is written by the victor and clearly after the demise of the rightly guided caliphate the victors were no longer rightly guided the author weaves through this difficult process and makes it clear for the readership this chapter can be an eye opener even for a student of islam that has spent lifetime on the topic\\noften when islamic criteria are discussed eyes roll and eye brows furrow in disbelief if it is all that simple why dont islamic scholars have consensus the author handles this topic like a pro in chapter  he analyzes current islamic scholars and deconstructs their thought process he has kind words for some but has nothing but scorn for the selfrighteous apologist scholars that have done great disservice to islam andor scientific cognition process one doesnt have to be personal but the writing is so clear one can hardly afford to not get angry at certain genre of scholars to anyones surprise this list is not made out of antiislamic nonmuslim scholars\\nchapter  is where proof of the pudding appears the author analyzes every major event of todays political arena and analyzes it with the islamic criteria of both jus ad bello and jus ad bellum the author comes up with an index to rank various countries and groups most interesting is the discussion on current us allies such as saudi arabia and how they rank among the biggest offenders of islam and islamic laws this is not a topic for the faint of heart but the author did an excellent job making it easily readable punctuated with numerous riveting arguments\\nchapter  is the conclusion and recommendation i have studied islam for some  years and yet i found these conclusions novel and entirely logical i doubt anyone would agree with the conclusions unless of course that person reads the entire book prior to reading the conclusion it is important to read the book in sequence\\nchapter  lists the bibliography and references it is many pages long and is quite comprehensive\\nchapter  is the appendix that lists the letters of the prophet it is a great idea to give the letters in original arabic so there is no room for misinterpretation let alone disinformation\\nanyone with knowledge of islam knows that jihad is in the core of islam and this book shows it is so and there needs to be no apology quite interestingly the author even depicts jihad as the roof of islam without the roof the fort of islam has no protection whatsoever this depiction captures the essence of protection security as well as integrity and puts away the notion of jihad being a weapon for crusade like aggression\\nthis book belongs to the desk of any researcher interested in knowing about islam or what islam can do to bring about peace on earth in order to live out the true meaning of the word islam that means peace through submission to the creator this book is equally useful for anyone interested in pursuit of peace and harmony that is truly elusive in todays world in this sense this book is a manual for world governance in peace',\n",

obamacare one thing is certain donald trump is extremely willing to toss out ideas and positions and then change his mind the following day unfortunately trump did this when initially exposing the connection between barack obama and hillary clinton and isis\\nit is an absolute fact that the united states was directly responsible for starting two more wars in the middle east in syria and libya both conflicts were deadly and destabilizing and waged at the request of israel as a wikileaks cable recently confirmed the mere idea that nations are trampled this way cements our understanding of how obama and clinton operate it also speaks volumes about the dark ways that the us has been manipulated by the zionist government of israel a nation that drains us taxpayers of more than  million a day the track record of human rights violations in israel goes well beyond unforgivable\\nthe isis expose was a golden moment for trump even though he didnt stick to his guns the wars the us has been waging in recent years are all unjustified conflicts used to make large amounts of money for groups like halliburton and mercenary organizations while the us government spends trillions on killing it has historically ignored the suffering its allies direct toward their own citizens one great example is saudi arabia the radical wahhabi government that still beheads people in public in strict violation of international lawthese problems have sullied us support for many years\\nthe only hope for the future lies in peace and reconciliation for clinton maintaining peace was a seemingly impossible task lest we forget it was her threats of war toward russia and iran that crossed the line for large numbers of americans parading as a liberal hillary clintons warmongering is legendary the democratic national committee debacle that derailed the only promising candidate bernie sanders was equally reprehensible\\nin the end there were no good choices for us voters the protrump crowd may not feel as victorious once they realize that mr trump does not care about them in any way shape or form only days after the election it is already being announced that the tax cuts trump promised will only be a fraction of what he claimed it is reminiscent of former us president george bushs famous words read my lips no new taxes of course each man offered the promise as an election gimmick each time it was enough to convince republicans trump is here to promote his own needs and to meet his own goals perhaps some of his political moves will coincide with the wishes of his voters perhaps not\\nin the meanwhile tempers are flaring and americans are increasingly turning against each other the real unavoidable truth is that donald trump will be the next us president he says he is going to make america great again and many of us wonder exactly what that means in the postwwii years there was peace unless you were black americans had freedom unless they were women or minorities\\nthe united states has always waged illegal wars dating back to the very beginning when one treaty with native people after another was broken is donald trump going to keep the us out of wars for the next four years it would be a very good thing if he did\\non one hand it seems entirely doubtful that the country will make it through four years of donald trump but giving up is not the answer if trump goes too far out of sync or becomes embroiled in charges that he cant pay off or threaten away there is an impeachment process that americans can follow',\n",

victory is a product of the ruling systems decline and crisis more than anything else the question is now what\\nwhat is urgently needed is a deep investigation of all aspects and contradictions of the trump moment first trump won because the capitalist system is in crisis the laws of the system have inevitably led to such a level of concentration that profit accumulation has turned into its opposite technological innovation has permanently replaced a large section of labor in the us creating the deindustrialized terrain trump spoke so much about in his campaign at the end of the day the profits that wall street speculated into the ground ultimately came from the compulsion to increase buying power with large debt schemes that could never be paid back by a working class whose wages have been in decline for over three decades \\nso when hillary clinton decided to campaign as some sort of united front against fascism few listened many people in the us saw clinton as an extension of the ruling establishment that had pummeled working class people into the ground the black lives matter movement exposed her complicity in the crime legislation that led to the vast expansion of the black prisoner population during her husbands rule hillary clinton then made the mistake of coalescing with the ruling establishments of both parties in hopes of isolating trump when in fact she merely exposed her role as a loyal servant of power\\nsome have claimed that since clinton won the popular vote she was the rightful winner regardless of her flaws others have argued that the republican party rightwing elites rigged the election  however true there will be no recall this time around why the dnc and the clinton campaign rigged the primaries in order to defeat sanders in a stunning shift of political legitimacy the democratic party has eviscerated all difference between itself and its republican party counterparts\\nnumerous pieces have been written about the dangers of

austerity magnate chris christie and privatization enthusiast newt gingrich however for the first time in a long time the president of the united states is accountable to something other than the ruling class in the past republican party and democratic party presidents dutifully served its paymasters while using manipulation to ensure that their respective bases were effectively

working class base of white america that propelled him to victory it is clear that the need to politically survive in hostile waters will compel trump to choose a neocon administration but a neocon agenda is exactly what his supporters voted against even those who directly or indirectly ascribe to white american nationalism are sick of endless war and austerity however nothing less can be expected from the likes of chris christie and newt gingrich\\nthe contradictions of the trump era will breed a social confrontation between classes not seen since the great depression white liberals and white nationalists will battle for the soul of the twoparty system the neocon establishment will have to confront trumps foreign and economic policy campaign rhetoric much of which is in direct antagonism with the gops record and the democratic party will attempt to use the age of trump as a time to regroup and steer the forces of resistance back into its camp\\nhow should the forces of resistance position themselves under this new set of conditions first the antiwar left needs to confront trumps foreign policy head on and place pressure on him to make good on his promises to scale back nato and its escalation toward russia the left needs to resist any and all attempts by trump to make good on some of his less savory proposals such as a the deportation of the million immigrants and the expansion of the us nuclear arsenal of course trumps rhetoric must be placed in its proper context it was the obama administration that signed a one trillion dollar agreement to modernize the us nuclear arsenal and deported nearly three million immigrants in eight years a number unseen in us history this means resistance to the trump administrations use of the apparatus that obama and the democrats built should be directed at the entire ruling class not just one of the two parties that represent it\\nthe vast majority of people simply cannot afford the resurrection of the twoparty

two centuries to even out  it is also true that merely ten percent white america owns almost all wealth in the us  capitalisms crisis has forced a large segment of the population to live under working

that a narrow outlook on this moment will breed narrow results it should be imperative that the left force trumps hand on foreign policy it should demand that trump use his executive powers to force through a st century glasssteagall act and create a federal jobs program to rebuild infrastructure in the us the left should not hesitate to condemn and protest whatever white supremacist and repressive policies come out of his administration with full recognition that it was democratic and republican party consensus that got us here as emotions run high and fear captures a number of

their governments and who wish to raise public awareness on these matters demonstrations rallies strikes pickets boycotts and so on are all ways of protesting as long as they are within the limits defined by the law protests and acts of similar nature are in essence an indisputable part of democracy freedom of opinion and expression\\nhowever in some cases protesting is exploited and used as a means of opposing democracy itself protests that give way to riots are now methods of staging coups to shut down administrations and overthrow democratically elected governments\\nlegitimacy of protests and feasibility of demands\\ndemocratic protests are welcomed by societies and addressed by governments to the extent that their demands are tangible justified and feasible  protests lacking those qualities are most likely to fail in having their demands met\\nthe antigovernment movement in bulgaria in  confirmed the validity of these qualities the protests took place in three separate cycles january and february witnessed rallies that objected to the high prices of electricity and demanded the government resign they were successful as the requests were sensible a later demonstration was against a government officer and resulted in his resignation yet another cycle of protests called for a change of the system along with some other illegal demands and faced defeat after turning into riots that were not supported by the overall society\\nmore gruesome video shows turkish soldiers execute female kurdish pkk fighters by shooting in their heads  bombers stopped by

followed the same pattern set in motion with a good willed and environmentalist approach it was likely to succeed considering its solid and feasible calls and legitimate ways at first the government heeded the nature lovers voices and took a positive step by postponing a construction project that required the destruction of gezi park yet the humanist approach of young people changed course in the wake of provocations of separatist and terrorist gangs and turned into a totally different nature demonstrations that began in gezi park in istanbul and that demanded the preservation of gezi park as a recreational area spread to other cities of the country and transformed into armed and bloody uprising imposing the fall of government it was a quite clear coup detat attempt that did not refrain from using violent methods and openly rejected the validity of a democratically elected government the protests were contradictory considering people took to streets using their democratic rights but then appealed to nondemocratic methods to lay their claims ignoring the will of the nation\\nthough justified at the beginning these two cases of protests demonstrate that they are open to hostile manipulations and may lose their legitimacy if left at the hands of illminded people recently some dark powers have been using this latest technique to manage countries internal affairs as they see fit and stage coups to overthrow governments they bring in professional teams of brutal killers amidst peaceful protests which then lead to violent antidemocratic clashes these protests sometimes end up in civil wars where fellows of the same nation kill one another it all happens in the wake of a governments nonyielding to some dark powers demands and a democratically elected government faces antidemocratic attempts\\nmethods of provocations and otpor\\nsuch dramatic outcomes come by the employment of social media social media becomes an instrument for organizing stirring and agitating the masses that are presumed to join the demonstrations various provocative organizations undertake the organization of some agents and provocateurs who take part in demonstrations by inciting them to get

nongovernmental institutions to act against democratically elected government in the name of democracy and to lead the public\\none of the most common groups among these  professional revolutionary

financial intelligence and political connections of otpor and features the following information based on wikileaks documents\\nserbias srdja popovic is known by many as a leading architect of regime changes in eastern europe and elsewhere since the lates  and as one of the cofounders of otpor popovic and otpors offshoot canvas have also maintained close ties with a goldman sachs executive and the private intelligence firm stratfor as well as the us government \\nsuch examples are easy to find the internal public opinion on otpor is that it is being employed as leverage to overthrow those governments which conflict with the interests of the us no wonder some media organizations that act on behalf of the us administration speak highly of otpor at every turn moreover the british media rigorously advocates that the executives of otpor have nothing to do with the organization of coups\\nlikewise some turkish media organizations disseminated similar statements during the  gezi park demonstrations the attempt to occupy the prime ministers residence by armed groups which is an act of rebellion against the state and treason by law was orchestrated by otpor according to reports yet the media deliberately defined it as the exercise of legitimate democratic rights and freedom of expression by the people and thus desired to create misapprehension to display the members of the marxist and separatist terrorist organizations who are far from representing even a slightest portion of the nation as the representatives of the nation these media organs called the nations security forces who risked their lives to preserve public order and peoples lives as the socalled enemies of freedom and democracy\\nin truth such mass demonstrations that aim to topple governments divide countries and organize bloody conflicts  and even civil wars  can no longer be called innocent rallies but subtle projects of deep states and shadow organizations to take over countries from within',\n",

terror of the black flag army it is communities of men which will gather in prayers and in mourning to perform the last rites of imam hussain ibn ali the grandson of the prophet muhammad\\nwhile arbaeen has eclipsed even the hajj in terms of attendance few  even within islam have ever heard of the pilgrimage let alone the tragedy it recalls never mind the principles it saw enacted\\narbaeen it needs to be said stands very much an offense to wahhabism  this dogma the house of saud has furiously promoted to assert its ascent to power arbaeen it needs to be emphasised actually speaks of this eternal struggle in between good and evil freedom and slavery piety and dogmatism\\n sidelined by mainstream media for it speaks of islams attachment and commitment to such values as justice freedom and compassion towards all men and all fashion of faiths arbaeen has nevertheless towered a beacon of hope amid the furious rise of radicalism arbaeen i would personally argue has become a grand symbol of resistance against oppression  the coming together of communities beyond their differences and most importantly perhaps in spite of their differences so that together they could oppose tyranny and offer the oppressed a rampart behind which to find refuge\\nfor those of you who still have no idea what in the world i am talking about allow me to tell you the story of a man  a man whose courage resolute strength of character and yearning for truth have echoed across the centuries to inspire generations upon generations to think themselves free and to rise themselves independent from the yoke of tyranny\\nmore messenger   muslims develop technology to promote religious unity against radicalism why muslims hold the biggest human gathering under the threat of isis in iraq the th days new campaign  communitybuilding and social solidarity shia muslims gather in dc for antiterror rally imam hussain ibn alis martyrdom in the plain of karbala over a millennium ago stands testimony to our collective struggle against injustice and though it is islams banner the third imam carried his message was a universal call for freedom  an immovable promise that real tragedy lies not in our failure to defeat tyrants but in our reluctance to oppose them\\nallow me to take you back a few centuries back when islams early history was still being written back when the name of the prophet muhammad was still murmured in the present tense through the lips of his progeny the house ahlulbayt\\nonly a few decades after islams last prophets passed islam stood divided as a nationstate its religious sovereignty challenged by men of greed and oppression yazid ibn muawiyah was one of them  arguably the most barbaric of them all since he envisioned slaughter to be the legacy of his throne\\nas bigots brandished islam to rationalise their heresy and proclaim righteous exceptionalism before the abomination of their deeds imam hussain had no other choice but to march against yazid  even if alone for as long as there was breath in him it is justice he would command for all people\\nand so the imam marched on  from the holy city of mecca to the thendeserted plain of karbala he walked knowing death would be his fate and still he pushed on \\nit is this determination to meet evil and not relent in the task which arbaeen speaks of most loudly it is allegiance loyalty and love pilgrims manifest into reality as they walk towards their imam united not faith but in their humanity\\narbaeen you most likely were never told is not exclusive to islam arbaeen is neither shia nor sunni arbaeen is for all who dare think themselves free under god and in him seek refuge\\nand while arbaeen has long been associated to shia islam for its school of thought revolve around those very principles imam hussain consecrated with his death the pilgrimage stands not in opposition or rejection of any faith  quite the contrary since christians yezidis hussainis brahims alongside countless other religious denominations have year after year centuries after centuries come to karbala to remember\\narbaeen is remembrance of hussain ibn ali remembrance of the word of god made complete through hussain the man the prophet muhammad called his son and whose leadership he commanded all believers to forever follow\\nif many failed in their allegiance for fear rendered them motionless before their imams calls hussains station in karbala has echoed ever since of a love so brilliant and unparalleled that all people all nations all faiths across time and space have found themselves compelled to walk the great walk of arbaeen  and through hussain ibn ali find their humanity\\narbaeen i have to say speaks to the best of our humanity it is home after all to the best of humanity  martyr among all martyrs there has never been a day like hussains day  and though his name wahhabism has worked to bury under the rubbles of history karbala has remembered its imam with fierce loyalty\\na city build around and for hussain ibn ali karbala is a declaration of allegiance to the house of the prophet  those extraordinary men and women whose hearts lips and prayers have spoken islam in wisdom and piety and without whom we would be orphans\\nevery year without fail karbala has fervently commemorated its imam  even in oppression especially when in oppression\\nbefore the poison of radicalism karbala has offered generosity and compassion before brutal repression karbala has opened its doors and to all oppressed offered a shelter before the depravity of sectarianism karbalas pulpits have called upon men and women to hold to rope of allah never to disunite\\na city surrounded by the evil of daesh karbala has never shun brighter\\nin the face of insane fanaticism imam hussains followers have never been braver\\nand so coming this november   karbala will let out a roar which will shook tyrants thrones karbala will offer all of its prayers and all of its devotion  hussains name will be etched on believers hearts tears of allegiance will flow fists will rise to the sky a promise that when called upon all will answer\\nislam today is best manifested in karbala since karbala shuns no one karbala today has put saudi arabia to shame since it has provided food and shelter to tens of millions of pilgrims  without expectation without any hope of a thank you\\na city has proven more generous and compassionate in its destitution than saudi arabia in its wealth and might where the socalled custodians of islam have cried the weight of the hajj on their

what crap facebook apparently carried fake news didnt the media invent and promote precisely this kind of news to bounce hillary over the last hurdle its convenient for media whores to blame everybody except themselves and hillarys corrupt campaign organization for her defeat clinton labeled ordinary americans deplorables displaying her contempt for half of the population hillary clinton was favorite puppet of the establishment she was the embodiment of a hopelessly corrupt political system and the american people realized it despite massive attempts by media presstitutes to sell her image an estimated  per cent of media outlets beat the drums for her and for her husbands corrupt clinton foundation\\nthe real reason behind the attempt to blame zuckerbergs facebook is that it makes everyone and no one responsible what is posted on facebook can no longer be controlled by the media and the political class they lost control of public opinion established methods of mindcontrol do not work any longer the fawning media report only what they are fed by government spindoctors it is more comfortable for them to act like the mouthpieces of their masters this holds true for us media as well of the media class in the european vassal states german media were for example as manipulative as those in the united states they celebrated president obama as the embodiment of good america ignoring that he waged wars during his entire presidency incarcerated several whistleblowers and signed off extralegal executions but he possessed a great advantage he was black or if you wish nonwhite obama was thus a nonwhite and smarter version of george w bush\\nwhen mark zuckerberg visited berlin in february  he was bootlicked by the german political and media class the springer group the most outspoken mouthpiece of us interests us in germany awarded him the axel springer award of greater political relevance was the dinner meeting between zuckerberg and chancellor angela merkel who tried to convince him to apply himself with more determination against socalled hatespeech on the internet the merkel regime considers that freedom of speech hurts her policy merkels minister of justice heiko maas has established some sort of a private internet police that hunts the web for hate speech whatever that means\\nthere is no agreed upon definition what hate speech implies hence the meaning can be volatile or arbitrarily the range of hate speech can range from antimuslim rhetoric via personal insults and threats to a call to kill every jewish zionist there is a duty of government under the international convention for the abolition of all forms of racial discrimination to prohibit the dissemination of racial propaganda ergo there exists a legal and ethical basis for prohibiting certain forms of hate speech\\neven restrictions to free speech extend to other spheres such as prohibition of deceitful advertising slandering other people and in some countries advertising tobacco and alcohol is forbidden in iceland human rights law accepts the right of governments to restrict freedom of speech in order to protect other social values there is a great deal of jurisprudence regarding the question who to weigh this right against other rights\\nin germany this body of private detectives includes civil society groups such as klicksafede jugendschutznet gesicht zeigen show your face to name a few the most eminent of these is the amadeu antonio foundation run by a former stasi agent by the name of anetta kahane who claims to fight racism antisemitism and xenophobia today she and her organization are at the forefront of criticizing people who dare to criticize the excesses of merkels policy of government failure\\ninternet giants such as facebook google and youtube and twitter also participated voluntarily in this constitutive meeting in which this kind of internet watchdog was set up in september  this new censorship body was established in the german ministry of justice and works since then without legal basis the participants agreed on best practices in handling hate messages there are no publically known criteria according to which one can recognize hate speach that means that this censorship body makes it decisions arbitrarily there are no rules or statutory provisions those whose messages are blocked have thus no legal recourse against such censorship despite such arbitrary practice the interim results which were presented in the ministry of justice on  september  were not satisfactory google and youtube and facebook representatives participated in the presentation of the results from august to september  punishable contents were reported that were deleted by the companies nevertheless the ministry of justice was not satisfied\\nthus it is not only the american political class which is blaming facebook for the defeat of its minion hillary clinton but also the german political class and its compliant media that intend to crack down on facebook fearing that ordinary people could endanger merkels quest for a renewed mandate as chancellor but what appears more important is their desperate attempt to control public opinion because the deplorables ie the mass of ordinary people do not anymore wish to be bamboozled by half a dozen editorsinchief the attempt to free themselves from such control has to be crushed with the help of facebook and google\\nat the beginning zuckerberg rejected the ridiculous accusations of being responsible for clintons defeat after a while it appears that he has accepted to do the dirty work for the censors and caved in on friday november   zuckerberg wrote on facebook that the amount of misinformation is relatively small nonetheless there is much work ahead on our roadmap the following work in progress was outlined by him\\na stronger detection system the most important thing we can do is to improve our ability to classify misinformation this means better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves\\n easy reporting making it much easier for people to report stories as fake will help us catch more misinformation faster\\n third party verification there are many respected fact checking organizations and while we have reached out to some we plan to learn from many more\\n warnings we are exploring labeling stories that have been flagged as false by third parties or our community and showing warnings when people read or share them\\n related articles quality we are raising the bar for stories that appear in related articles under links in news feed\\n disrupting fake news economics a lot of misinformation is driven by financially motivated spam were looking into disrupting the economics with ads policies like the one we announced earlier this week and better ad farm detection\\n listening we will continue to work with journalists and others in the news industry to get their input in particular to better understand their fact checking systems and learn from them\\napparently zuckerberg understands the importance of the issue i beg to differ the issue is not about fake news it is about universal freedom of speech that poses a threat to the mindcontrol industry owned by a few families on both sides of the atlantic ocean if they lose this control of public opinion they rightly fear to lose in the long run their privileges\\ndear mr zuckerberg take courage and do not interfere with ordinary folks speaking their minds despite the pressure and intimidation by the political and media class\\nwhen one discusses freedom of expression and the role of facebook one point needs special scrutiny namely the private character of this entity the private character of an entity precludes transparency citizens and users do not possess any rights to inspect the finances let alone participate in determining facebook projects and policies as a citizen one cannot accept that one unelected person however nice he may be could determine the projects and policies of an entity that is now serving billions of human beings such a structure just cries for corruption and arbitrary rule one can see this operating within wikipedia where doctrinaires exert control over subjects of social science such as the circumstances of  or the israelpalestinian conflict its impossible to even insert critical question because they dont pass the censorship of certain guardians of mind control google is another such leviathan that cries for public and transparent ownership how such public ownership of a global corporation is to be accomplished is a question that begs for an answer the first step would certainly be for civil society without influence from the corporate world to get together and consider a more democratic and transparent structure for such global services it would be wise for civil society to get going before corporations will establish fake democratic forums to preempt this goal',\n",

historian jms careless as my phd supervisor i made a commitment to study the history of colonial relations with the first nations of canada my course of study took me in  to my first appointment in the native studies department at the university of sudbury the university of sudbury was in those years a jesuitrun entity it formed the institutional seed from which the secular laurentian university would emerge in the decades prior to my appointment there\\nfor the next two decades i was able to work from my academic bases in sudbury and then in lethbridge alberta beginning in  at the invitation

greater israel eretz israel it was joshua who also led me to my first interactions with iranian journalists resulting in my participation in the new horizon conference of the autumn of  as i have described in writing elsewhere this episode proved to make a major positive impact on me\\ndue to the intervention of my colleague the mohawk activist splitting the sky i also began to see the events of  as a major factor in the shaping of the global geopolitics in the twentyfirst century\\nmy quest for new academic turf at the has sometimes been bumpy and contested certainly many major obstacles were put in the way of my promotion to full professor eventually my academic peers were allowed to make their input into the promotion process apart from the artificial blockages thrown up by my university administration in  after what i took to be my obtaining a position of intellectual and professional security as a senior faculty member i resolved that henceforth i would pursue difficult lines of research and publication i made this decision with an understanding that less secure younger colleagues might eschew such a course of action\\ni have made no secret of the fact that i see the recent surrender of the high ground of academic freedom by the members of the administration of the as an indicator that canada is on a downwards spiral it seems to me there is a move a foot to sabotage the intellectual freedom of our universities if academic freedom is not to be respected in institutions of supposedly higher learning then there can be no basis for freedom of speech in environments not subject to the protections of tenure\\nthe first to suffer the crackdown in universities will be our students they will have to deal with the fact that the treatment visited on me indicates it has become dangerous to ask pointed questions which might produce answers embarrassing to power our country canada cannot progress to higher levels of discourse and achievement under these repressive conditions\\nayatollah khamenei believes exchanging viewpoints and opinions are in the nature of academic work how is this principle practiced at lethbridge university\\ni agree that exchanging viewpoints and opinions is a central aspect of academic work within universities and between universities i found that there was a good deal of openness to the exchange of information and ideas with colleagues media and public officials in the years between  and  when the core of my academic work revolved around the history of canadafirst nations relations\\nunfortunately i would have to say that the obstacles to the exchange of information and ideas began to mount significantly after  when i began to question the official narrative of what happened on  who really did what to whom during the initiating events of what soon became known as the global war on terror as i began to become skeptical of the official narrative i noticed more and more inclination on the part of colleagues to distance themselves from the subjects that captured my professional interest to put it bluntly i suppose it became clear to me that for a number of reasons it was not a good career move for younger colleagues to show interest in the subject of  specifically and false flag terrorism more generally\\nas i began to look more deeply into the existing research on  i was simultaneously drawn to the subject of war crimes and international law my collaboration with splitting the sky became more intense when we went to work to organize in response to the decision of the former us president george w bush to give a talk in calgary in  as his first public engagement as theoretically a regular civilian citizen our collective action in calgary in the spring of  led to a trial that we dubbed splitting the sky versus george w bush  although i had not yet associated the lies and crimes of  with israel first protagonists i ran into my first zionist pushback for my  studies when i presented my essay should george w bush be arrested in calgary alberta to be tried for international crimes i originally presented the paper at an invited talk at the university of winnipeg\\nmy essay eventually ended up as an exhibit in the litigation that we referred to as splitting the sky versus george w bush  our stance was that the former us president should have been arrested in canada for being a crediblyaccused war criminal we were far from alone in bringing forward evidence that bush had violated many international covenants and conventions against for instance prohibited torture not only had he arguably violated international law but it seemed the former us president had violated canadas own crimes against humanity and war crimes act  the legislation had passed through parliament with the view that canada should not become a haven for war criminals\\nin pursuing this line of analysis i faced my first allegations that somehow my academic inquiry was antisemitic\\nas i worked on this subject one that i integrated into my pedagogy it became clear to me that we have never seen anything but victors justice when it comes to the enforcement of international law against those that commit war crimes crimes against humanity crimes against the peace and crimes against democracy it seems that only those on the losing side of military conflicts are ever brought to justice those on the winning side the stronger side are invariably held to be above the law\\nthis line of scholarly investigation did result in various channels of academic exchange opening up for me with colleagues in my own university and other universities the most fruitful collaboration to develop however was that with dr kevin barrett who had lost his academic position at the university of wisconsin for incorporating related subjects into his research and pedagogy\\nfor sure i should not be made to feel so alone in the academy when it comes to the study of  the most transformative event of the twentyfirst century in my view the academic institutions in north america and europe have failed abysmally in the study of false flag terrorism starting with the events of  i am particularly appalled by how this failure on the part of our institutions of higher learning has contributed to the rise of islamophobia as the necessary psychological condition giving license to those promoting the invasions of muslimmajority countries\\nin a meeting with president rouhani and his cabinet the leader of the islamic revolution said when it comes to caricatures insulting the sanctities of islam the west suddenly becomes an advocates of freedom and the freedom of expression however when it comes to the holocaust there is no freedom of expression why do you think we witness such double standards\\na gross display of double standards plagues the ethnocentric way freedom is being defined in the socalled west the psychological operations attending the we are charlie hebdo ceremonies on paris in early  epitomized the hypocrisy the whole essence of this strange event in the city of lights seemed to signal that freedom of speech and expression in the west is virtually limitless when it comes to demeaning through cartoons of prophet mohammed as well as other sacred symbols of islamic religion the other side of the same coin are the many prohibitions imposed on for instance the french comedian mbala mbala dieudonné dieudonné was barred from entering canada for his efforts to make humor of the paranoid state of affairs attending any public references to jews jewish institutions or the activities of israel these days\\none of my discoveries through this period of crisis is the fact that the thought police agents in the bnai brith equate my call for open debate on the holocaust and indeed open debate on all subjects as the equivalent of socalled holocaust denial how many of my colleagues at the and in other universities have bent before the harsh intimidation how many have made themselves proponents of shutting down open debate and allowing censorship from outside the academy to regulate our research teaching and publication\\nthere is a controversial quote from ayatollah khamenei in which he says may god curse all those who put an end to political thoughts work and endeavor in universities whats your take on that how essential do you think such a perspective is for the academia\\ni agree wholeheartedly with the supreme leaders observation one of the great gifts of the creator to humans is the gift of reason and rationality our application of reason and rationality to our understanding of society will inevitably contribute to political thought work and endeavor\\nthis type of applied reason should be especially vital in the work of universities where the highest level of political conception should be able to find expression elaboration and receptiveness indeed we need to make ourselves expert in universities at making safe places for the development of political discourse god curse us in the universities if we cannot be the home for vibrant political discourse',\n",

imperial presidency of the united states has evolved over the last century to the point that the executive holds certain powers that can be considered dictatorial arguably the most consequential decision in politics is to wage war the constitution specifically reserves this right for congress the president as commanderinchief directs the wars that congress declares however starting with trumans intervention in the korean war in  and continuing with invasions of vietnam grenada iraq and afghanistan and the bombings of dozens more countries the presidents ability to unilaterally initiate war with a sovereign nation has been normalized congress has not declared war since  despite the fact the us military has intervened in nearly every corner of the world\\nin recent years george w bush assumed the power to kidnap torture and assassinate any individual anywhere in the world at any time without even a pretense of due process upon replacing bush barack obama legitimized bushs kidnapping and torture by refusing to prosecute the perpetrators or provide recourse to the victims while enthusiastically embracing the power to assassinate at will noam chomsky said obama has trashed the yearold magna carta which king john of england would have approved of\\ncan there be anything more dictatorial than the power of a single individual to kill and make war at will while

presidentelect donald trump headed for the white house to be sworn in on january   while hillary clinton will fade into obscurity and the protesters will eventually go home just to criticize everything trump does for the next four maybe  years and progressives will get over their sworn revolution within the party between liberals and moderate democrats the ultimate losers are not clinton supporters celebrities that swore to leave the country if trump won nor democrats as a party it is the mainstream media that was rendered irrelevant crushed by a wave of deplorables and alternative media bypassing their onceinfluential status to communicate without their fasle prism of truth msms last gasp now they are offering their mea culpas dedicating countless hours and ink to explaining and justifying how they were so wrong in their predictions that they knew ahead of time were based on a false premise and taking their last gasp by swearing to rededicate themselves to reporting honestly while at the same time claiming they reported on both candidates fairlyi kid you notbelow is a letter by arthur o sulzberger jr and dean baquet the publisher and editor of the new york timesfirst point is that if they had been reporting fairly as claimed in the letter above they would not need to rededicate themselves to honesty secondly they did not strive to understand and reflect all political perspectives and life experiences of trump supporters rather they maligned criticized belittled and mocked anybody that did not agree with their superior and smug political opinionwhile it is to be expected that trump supporters verbally abused on a regular basis will not forget nor forgive media outlets such as the times the public editor liz spayd who works independently with the job of examining the times with an eye to protecting journalistic integrity and good practices describes the reaction from other members of the public to their reporting readers are sending letters of complaint at a rapid rate heres one that summed up the feelings succinctly from kathleen casey of houston now that the world has been upended and you are all to a person in a state of surprise and shock you may want to consider whether you should change your focus from telling the reader what and how to think and instead devote yourselves to finding out what the reader and nonreaders actually think another letter from nick crawford of plymouth mich made a similar point perhaps the election result would not be such a surprise if your reporting had acknowledged what ordinary americans care about rather than pushing the limited agenda of your editors he wrote please come down from your new york city skyscraper and join the rest of us what ms spayd does not acknowledge is that their reporting will not and cannot change as long as their publisher and editor the ones that wrote the letter in the image above continue to insist their reporting during the campaign season was in any way fair or to even pretend they attempted to understand and reflect all political perspectives what ms spayd also does not address is the fact that five different new york times reporters accepted the invitations for the offtherecord gatherings to frame the hrc message with the clinton campaign staff before her campaign launched including gail collins jonathan martin maggie haberman patrick healy and amy chozick all of which consistently penned hit pieces against trumpit is heartening to see that outlets like the new york times are being called to the carpet by their own readers as well as admitting they are losing subscribers because while trump supporters were maligned and lied about their readers were misinformed and lied to  the countrys major news organizations as surprised as anybody by donald j trumps ascension to the presidency faced a question from their audiences on wednesday that was laced with a sense of betrayal and anger how did you get it so wrong the question came in letters to editors and writers of the nyt one reader wrote you were so wrong for so long you misled your readers and were blinded by your own journalistic bigotry it came in facebook posts you were in a bubble and werent paying attention to your fellow americans the filmmaker michael moore wrote in a post shared more than  times most ominously it came in the form of canceled subscriptions something that will surely be monitored former times reporter michael goodwin offers the times some free advice  using an outside law firm or even inhouse reporters he must assess how and why baquet made the decision to sever the paper from its roots he must assess the impact on reporters and editors and whether they felt pressure to conform their stories to baquets political bias whatever the findings the publisher must insist that the standards of fairness again become a fundamental tenet in the news room as an added guarantee he must insist that the paper enlarge its thinking about diversity to include journalists who disagree with the times embedded liberal slant there has to be a difference of perspective to judge where fairness lies readers and former readers should be part of the process many already know that the paper must get its head out of parochial new york and into the hearts and minds of americans everywhere this is about survival if it doesnt change now the gray ladys days surely are numbered bottom line frankly i believe traditional medias days are numbered whatever they do and they are on their last gasp there are too many independent journalists and alternative news sites from both sides of the political aisle that are rendering them irrelevant while alternative media has its own set of biases the majority always provide links documents when available video clips and other methods for readers to verify research and come to their own conclusions something mainstream media doesnt want readers to do because they feel they have the right to lead the public where the msm wants them to go rather than inform the public and trust them to make their own determinations',\n",

stockholm for the identitarian conference some swedes and i compared notes on whose country was the most crazyliberal and antiwhite the swedes pointed to a short video recently released by an ngo that said swedes should integrate into the culture of thirdworld immigrants to form a new country \\nmy swedish colleagues agreed with french author renaud camus writing on free west media  he argues that whereas white populations everywhere seem determined to be replaced by thirdworlders the case of sweden is even more tragic more extreme more insane nowhere else do a people and a nation show a stronger will to suicide \\nbut i believe south africa is worse we have actual laws regulations and policies that require corporations universities and sports bodies to replace whites our country has become the world champion of antiwhite antiwestern ideology together with our northern neighbor zimbabwe we are to multiculturalism what pol pots shortlived democratic kampuchea was to communism its most extreme expression pol pot waged genocide against the entire middle class of cambodia in order to start a new society \\nsouth africas ruling elite also wants a new society that will be cleansed of western influences and even the white race as robert mugabe put it during his famous  visit to soweto i dont want to see a white face \\nthe current upheavals at our universitiesknown absurdly as the fallist movementhave been widely reported enraged black students egged on by understanding whites have demanded that one thing after another must fall each accompanied by its own hashtag first it was rhodesmustfall the statue of cecil rhodes at the university of cape town then afrikaansmustfall blacks want to eliminate afrikaans as a language of university instruction followed by feesmustfall they want tuition fees abolished and now sciencemustfall \\nin a video that has had nearly a million views a female black student at the university of cape town called for science to be scrapped saying \\nif i personally were committed to decolonization science as a whole is a product of western modernity and the whole thing should be scratched off so if you want practical solutions to how to decolonize science we have to restart science fromi dont knowfrom an african perspective from our perspective from how weve experienced science for instance i have a question for all the science people there is a place in kzn called umhlabuyalingana they believe that through the magic the black magicyou call it black magic they call it witchcraftyou are able to send lightening to strike someone can you explain that scientifically because its something that happens \\nthe initial reaction was widespread ridicule from ordinary whites but i knew that her dismissal of western science was not taking place in a vacuum and was connected with the culturalmarxist ideas swirling through most western universities after all herbert marcuse one of the founders of cultural marxism wrote this in an essay on liberation in  at the height of us student radicalism \\nthis is the hippie subculture tripgrasspotacid and so on but a far more subversive universe of discourse announces itself in the language of black militants here is a systematic linguistic rebellion which smashes the ideological context in which the words are employed and defined and places them into the opposite contextnegation of the established one thus the blacks take over some of the most sublime and sublimated concepts of western civilization desublimate and redefine them p  \\nneedless to say marcuse approved of the black take over and if he were alive today he would surely applaud what is happening in south africa not only are blacks taking over western concepts and changing them into their opposites they are taking over our institutions as well \\nin universities and the mainstream media there was actually praising this young fallist i was only slightly surprised to read a piece in afrikaans entitled  sciencemustfall nie so belaglik soos dit mag klink  sciencemustfall not so ridiculous as it sounds it was written by liezel de lange the managing director of our sunday newspaper rapport  which once supported apartheid and segregation \\nmiss de lange first confessed ignorance because she attended the university of pretoria in the days when it still taught western ideas and culture she laments that when she studied english literature almost all our prescribed works were from britain and ireland as well as the usa i have to give my lecturers at the time credit for assigning readings from wole soyinka chinua achebe and ngugi wa thiongo most westerners no doubt have deficient educations because they have not been taught ngugi wa thiongo \\nalthough liezel de lange did not exactly endorse the sciencemustfall idea in defense of the young fallist she evoked the mythical medieval african university of timbuktu as evidence that africas vast contributions to world learning are being ignored in fact timbuktu was a center for islamic and tuareg schools not a hub of forgotten african or black science nor are africans themselves united in wanting to preserve what is left of the medieval african university recent al qaeda activity in the region has been so destructive that the new yorker recently ran a story called  has the great library of timbuktu been lost  \\ni asked liezel de lange on twitter whether she was an afrocentrist but she evaded the question answering that she merely posits that not all knowledge wisdom and insight come from the west its hard to disagree with that \\nmiss de langes column was just a watereddown version of a more radical piece she had read on the leftwing website the daily maverick by joel modiri called  in the fall decolonisation and the rejuvenation of the academic project in south africa  \\nmr modiri is a black academic at unisa university of south africa which has been racially transformedmeaning that whites have been all but banished it is africas largest correspondence university naturally founded by south african whites mr modiri explained that her the fallists error proves her point he decried \\nthe presentation of knowledge by south african universities as predominantly the product of the west and the failure to recognize that some of the major scientific disciplines medicine physics astronomy mathematics among others have deep heritages in africa china and india     \\nin other words she is a victim of the false eurocentric view that science is western to begin with some american blacks have long maintained that the west stole its knowledge from africa they never explain how science could be stolen from one people by another leaving no trace behind knowledge is not like the mona lisa which cannot exist in more than one place so it is strange that the wise africans who conceived of science and culture no longer possessed it once it was stolen from them \\nbut we have to remember samuel huntingtons dictum in his book the clash of civilizations and the remaking of world order  culture follows power if anything this is what the rest of the world might learn from south africa whoever dominates politically will impose his culture and beliefs even if they are more primitive than those it replaces once the scientist has been politically and culturally subjugated he may have to bow down to the witchdoctor \\nunfortunately it is not only pseudointellectual blacks such as mr modiri who hate the west one of the most europhobic statements in support of the black uct student came from stuart theobald a whiteliberal english south african academic who divides his time between london and johannesburg \\nin the same rapport that liezel de lange edits mr theobald writes of the need to decolonize science because it has been used to justify racism and to support biological racism he continues \\nwe are kidding ourselves if we pretend that colonial attitudes are not still affecting the way science works today this is why a deliberate effort to decolonise science is valuable and south african universities have the opportunity to lead the charge \\nhe adds that we need a new paradigm in science that recognises the racism embedded in much of scientific practice and methodology and that a postcolonial science that is shorn of the straitjacket of past thinking will solve problems that now baffle us he notes the fuss made over the fallist students comments and then asks but when you see the entanglement of racism and science can you blame her \\nare south african blacks and white liberals ready to ditch science in favor of the dark arts as harry potter would say if they have tooth aches or appendicitis i suspect they will submit to the humiliation of colonial science rather than look for a cure in the traditional rituals and voodoo of africa',\n",

       " 'posted on october   media selfdestruct over trump jared taylor american renaissance october   their hysteria and dishonesty have backfired \\nfrom the start of donald trumps campaign the media have covered him dishonestly they have consistently portrayed him as a closet white supremacist who deliberately appeals to racists they have tried to tie him to a wicked movement known as the altright they are now working on another dishonest angle that donald trump is mainstreaming hate and bringing racism into public discourse the media clearly want to stampede voters into mrs clintons camp so as to spare us the agony of a racist in the white house \\nthe demonization campaign has backfired by trying to hang racial dissidents around donald trumps neck the media have given american renaissance and other organizations far more publicity than ever before at the same time constant shouts of racist and bigot dont seem to hurt mr trump instead they are wrecking what is left of media credibility the biggest irony though is that donald trump is probably not one of us at all but even small deviations from the castiron orthodoxy of race are enough to plunge our rulers into dark fantasies about donald trump as a secret david duke fan \\nmedia dishonesty started immediately when mr trump pointed out that some immigrants from mexico were criminals the press acted as if he had said all mexican immigrants are criminals then when alert news hounds discovered that those of us they love to call haters and white supremacists liked mr trump there was no end of articles with titles such as  meet the horde of neonazis klansmen and other extremist leaders endorsing donald trump   top racists and neonazis back donald trump   heil donald trump neonazis white supremacists show support  and  the white nationalists who support donald trump  \\nthese articles had a simpleminded purpose discredit mr trump by parading before the reader any nazi kluxer or racially conscious white person who had anything nice to say about the candidate the implication was that if racists were going to vote for donald trump he must be racist too \\nthis was deceitful and onesided when the chairman of the american communist party endorsed hillary clinton  no one suggested this meant she was a communist \\nit is true that mr trump gave the media just enough of an excuse to pretend he really is a closet bigot because he did not repudiate racists with the snorts of indignation respectability requires there was the famous exchange in february when a reporter pushed mr trump to disavow an endorsement from david duke as the hill reported it  david duke endorsed me ok alright i disavow ok trump said seeking to quickly move on to another question \\nthat same month there was another famous exchange with jake tapper of cnn  \\ntapper  will you unequivocally condemn david duke and say that you dont want his vote or that of other white supremacists in this election \\ndonald trump  well just so you understand i dont know anything about david duke ok i dont know anything about what youre even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists so i dont know i dont know did he endorse me or whats going on because you know i know nothing about david duke i know nothing about white supremacists \\nthe media leaped on these exchanges with shouts of joy trump refuses to disavow white supremacists thats because he is one \\nthere are far better explanations first donald trump is a pugnacious man he doesnt like being pushed around by anyone especially not by journalists who hate him if mr tapper had belligerently demanded that mr trump agree that the sky is blue mr trump would have bridled at that \\nsecond donald trump probably doesnt know anything about david duke or white supremacy i would be astonished if he has ever looked into the thinking of david duke or any other alleged white supremacist it is his feistiness and his ignorance of white advocacy that explain his answers not some carefully concealed racial consciousness \\nthe press has also pounced on donald trumps retweets of racist material which is supposed to be yet more proof that he is a secret supremacist business insider for example published this shocking story   times donald trump has engaged with altright racists on twitter  not one of these tweets is obviously racist and it would be surprising if mr trump or his skeleton staff took the time to vet the sources of the thousands of tweets realdonaldtrump has sent during the campaign \\nnow the press is working on another smeartrump angle recently i have been contacted by journalists from such places as bloomberg news reuters and the new york times  who clearly want to write that donald trump is mainstreaming hate that he is responsible for a huge surge in the altright they want to know about all the people who have been flocking to amrencom because of what donald trump says they want me to tell them about people who have been emboldened to speak out against minorities because donald trump has led the way they would love to find someone who now thinks he is free to run down the street shouting nigger because mr trump wants to take a hard look at muslim immigrants \\ni have explained to them as patiently as i can that they have it the wrong way around no one comes looking for amrencom because donald trump wants to build a wall they come looking for us because the media have written about us in their attempt to convince the world that mr trump is a racist they come looking for us because mrs clinton kindly called attention to us by complaining about the altright and her basket of deplorables i also try to explain that if the media had not launched its malicious campaign of trying to hold donald trump responsible for the views of certain people who support him few people would have heard of the altright in their zeal to paint their enemy in the darkest colors they are promoting the altright not donald trump \\ni explain that racial dissent has been growing like never before for reasons that have nothing to do with the campaign it is trayvon martin michael brown black lives matters and black rioters who are sending hundreds of thousands of frustrated white people our way not donald trump this will not change whether mr trump wins or loses the top landing pages on amrencom are analyses of race and crimesomething mr trump never talks about \\ni also explain to reporters that it is idiotic to think mr trump has mainstreamed hate by which they mean sensible observations about race i ask them to name a single person who has been emboldened to say something racist just because donald trump is the gop nominee of course they cant if anything it is the opposite mr trump has been called every name under the sun for the mildest most commonsense observations about muslims and immigration anyone tempted to come out of the closet is likely to hesitate more than ever things could change if mr trump becomes president but the candidate himself has done very little to spread our ideas \\nwhat donald trump has done is spark an unprecedented interest in politics among disaffected young people who recognize that mitt romney and john mccain are no different from barack obama when it comes to preserving whites their society and their culture i know a number of millennials who never bothered to vote before but who certainly will in november i know some who have made their first political contribution or who have spent weekends volunteering for the trump campaign \\ni point out to reporters that this is what elections are supposed to be all about giving the voters real choices i note that the trumpclinton contest will almost certainly produce a record voter turnout for a modern election havent our rulers been wringing their hands over a lack of political engagement especially among the young well now they have engagement alright but they dont like it they dont like it because so many people are stumping for the candidate they love to call a  threat to democracy  liberals are such transparent hypocrites they claim to love democracy but suddenly start worrying about its health if the people refuse vote the way they tell them to \\nthe whole trumpisaracist fracas shows just how painfully fragile orthodoxy has become i may be wrong but i have no reason to think donald trump thinks at all as we do he has never said or done anything to suggest he is anything more than an ordinary american with normal instincts he doesnt want criminals sneaking across the border he thinks sanctuary cities for illegals are crazy he doesnt see why we need more muslims and he is angry when immigrants go on welfare millions of ordinary americans clearly agree with him and not because they are racially aware it is because they are decent fairminded people who also have a nagging sense that the country is changing in unwelcome ways \\ni am convinced that mr trump does not have a sophisticated understanding of race so far as i can tell he doesnt have a sophisticated understanding of much of anything he has stumbled by instinct onto a few sensible policies that white advocates have been promoting for a long time but not because he is one of us \\nmaybejust maybehe will move in our direction its not impossible to imagine a president trump asking in an offhand way whats wrong with white people wanting to remain a majority in the united states or he might casually note that you cant expect as many blacks as asians in ap classes because they dont have the same levels of intelligence but i can imagine the opposite too president trump so bogged down in beltway baloney that he never even builds the wall \\nthere is one thing that donald trump has changed he has proven that republican bromides about taxes and small government dont excite people he has proven that there is tremendous anger against political insiders of both parties he has proven that americans do want their country to come first they dont want it to try to save the world or to be a dumping ground for people who have wrecked their own countries \\nand even if he has not mainstreamed racism he has shown that if you have a backbone you can withstand what is surely the most intense and concentrated program of hate ever directed at an american on october  roger cohen wrote in the new york times that donald trump is a phony liar blowhard cheat bully misogynist demagogue predator bigot bore egomaniac racist sexist sociopath and a dictatorinwaiting with a brats temper and a prigs scowl this must be one of the most unhinged hysterical outbursts in the history of american political journalism and it is unusual only for its wordiness not its tone \\ndont the editors of the times realize that this kind of frothing explains why more americans believe in bigfoot  percent than trust newspapers  percent virtually the entire industry is so consumed with rage at donald trump and contempt for his supporters that it cannot control itself open petulant bias is driving more and more americans to social media and to sites like amrencom for their news \\ndespite the concerted shrieking of virtually the entire american ruling class donald trump is going to get close to half of the vote on november  some  million people are going to vote for a man for whom roger cohen has emptied his dictionary trying to insult only one major newspaper has endorsed donald trump only one  and this is a man whom the american people might choose as their president what better proof could we have of the stark difference between printed opinion and public opinion between what americans think and what our rulers want us to think donald trump has ripped away whatever was left of the pretense of media objectivity \\nwhether he wins or not whether he is one of us or not donald trump has laid bare the collusion between big media and a political system in which both parties collaborate to run the country in their interests and those of their big donors votersfinallyhave a chance to vote against the entire corrupt system on november th they could bring it crashing down but even if it still stands it is visibly weakened badly discredited these are the perfect conditions in which our ideas will flourish as never

some  killed on the battlefield is a fit revenge for the deception and murder committed by the zulus  months earlier \\nprelude to war \\nthe great clash between the boer and zulu nations was not as leftist historians like to claim the result of ruthless white colonialism suppressing an indigenous people it came about because the zulus rejected an extremely reasonable attempt at negotiation by the boers \\nthe boers pioneers of dutch french and german descent were the people who opened up much of what was later to become south africa their first antecedents had landed on the southernmost tip of africa in  only  years after the virginia company settled on jamestown island \\nwhen they arrived in the area now known as cape town whites came into contact only with hottentots and bushmen as the number of europeans increased they expanded east and north only meeting their first black tribe the xhosa some  miles away on south africas east coast the xhosas were migrating south fleeing the warlike zulu to the north who were engaged in imperialist expansion of their own \\nfor just under a century white settlement halted at this eastern frontier border formed by the coast and firm xhosa settlement it was not however a time of peace as xhosa were constantly raiding the boers who lived on the border this caused much harm and discontent among the farmers who blamed the dutchruled colonial government back in cape town for the lawlessness \\nit only added to the border farmers grievances when the british took the cape colony from the dutch in  to prevent the colony from falling into french hands during the napoleonic wars it was vital to control the merchant and naval refitting station on the way to the far east the new colonial masters not only started anglicizing the colony when they abolished slavery they offered compensation that amounted to hardly a quarter of a slaves value \\nexasperated by incessant xhosa attacks and british attempts to suppress their language and culture groups of frontier farmers filled with a sense of manifest destiny not seen again until the opening of the american west set forth to the north and the east in a movement known as the great trek the trekkers they became known as voortrekkers or pioneers only after  bypassed the xhosa in search of new unsettled territory in which they could establish independent boer nations all told it was only a small minority of no more than  boers who made the trek to the future natal orange free state and transvaal regions they traveled in several waves of covered oxdrawn wagons much like the conestogas in which americans opened the west \\nthe boer leader of the time piet retief had written the trekker manifesto in which he spelled out the farmers longheld grievances against the british by the boer wagons had crossed the great mountain range into natal in an act of audacity that few thought possible the range the highest in southern africa had been named the drakensbergthe dragon mountainsbecause they were said to be impassable \\nretief had identified a large piece of uninhabited land to the north of the zulu kingdom which lay open to settlement retief knew that if he wanted the land for his people he could take it unopposed however he wanted to live in peace with his zulu neighbors and before taking possession he opened negotiations with the zulu king dingaan he wanted no misunderstanding between the two peoples \\nhe sent a letter to the zulu king explaining why he wanted to speak to him and first visited dingaans capitala large circle of reed and grass hutson november   retief left the main body of trekkers and went to the zulu kings capital umgungundhlovo the place of the elephant to negotiate a treaty that would allow boers peacefully to settle land adjoining the zulu kingdom dingaan said he would let the boers live in natal if they recovered cattle stolen by a tlokwa chieftain retief and his men did so and dingaan agreed to give the land to the boers \\nretief returned to umgungundhlovo on february   to finalize the agreement he arrived with  volunteers including his own son and three children of other menit was common for children to accompany their fathers on expeditions of this kind the next day retief and dingaan formally signed a treatythe zulu king made his mark by scratching an x on the documentgiving possession of the land to the boers delighted the boers sent scouts back to the main encampments to report the successful outcome and made ready to leave as retief and his party were about to saddle up a messenger arrived from dingaan inviting the boer party to a special celebration to mark the signing retief was suspicious but did not want to offend dingaan as they had on previous visits the boers stacked their firearms neatly outside the reed walls and entered the royal enclosure unarmed \\nas they ate and drank a zulu impi or warrior unit put on a dance for the guests according to the account of a white missionary who was present the dancing warriors drew ever closer to the boers till they were just in front of the seated whites when the zulu king leaped to his feet and shouted kill the white wizards the impi fell upon the surprised boers some of them drew their hunting knives and tried to fight off the attackers but they were quickly overwhelmed \\nthe zulu warriors bound the whites with reed ropes and dragged them to hlomo amabutho the hill of execution near the zulu capital there they clubbed the boers to death one by one with retief kept until last and forced to watch his son being murdered after retiefs heart was extracted and presented to dingaan as proof that the boer leader was dead the bodies were left for the vultures in accordance with zulu custom \\ndingaan then gave orders for the full might of his army to attack the boer camps the settlers had received the message retief had sent earlier and believed everything had gone well they were therefore completely unprepared and badly undermanned the  men in retiefs party were all dead many other men had gone hunting leaving only a light guard for the women and children the boers were so confident there would be peace that they had not even posted sentries just before dawn barking dogs aroused the outlying wagons then thousands of zulu warriors attacked the several hundred trekkers  women children and old men  as they lay sleeping \\nthe boer historian gustav preller who interviewed survivors left a harrowing account of the aftermath all around dozens and dozens of bodies  babies who had had their heads smashed open against the wagon wheels women dishonored and in some zulu custom their breasts cut off  in a wagon blood filled to a height of several inches the life blood of an entire family ebbed out where they lay  jan bezuidenhout one of the few young men who had not gone ahead with the retief party grabbed his fourmonthold baby daughter out of her crib and ran off through the undergrowth  having lost his pursuers a few miles away bezuidenhout checked for the first time on his daughter in his arms she was dead a single spear stroke had killed her \\nthe slaughter became known as the weenen the dutch word for weeping and a town of that name still stands near the site of the  boers camped in the area zulus killed some  including  children the rest survived because grazing requirements for their animals meant that the boer camps had to be widely dispersed if dingaans men had scouted more thoroughly found all the encampments and attacked them simultaneously the slaughter would have been far greater \\npretorius arrives \\nthe boers now faced their greatest challenge their camps were full of wounded men orphaned children and widows the zulus had stolen an estimated  head of cattle and sheep during the weenen slaughter and ammunition was running low the zulu armies might return at any time and they were a formidable force as the boers discovered when they launched a raid to avenge the massacre on april    trekkers under a divided command of piet uys and hendrik potgieter rode into zulu territory only to be defeated by some  warriors not far from umgungundhlovo in what became known as the battle of italeni \\nthis new disaster forced the boers to face reality they had to either abandon their quest for independence and return to the cape colony or find some means to fight their way through the widows and orphans argued strongly for pushing on they knew that if they fell back to the cape they would have to live on charity whereas if dingaan could be defeated they could at least recover their livestock many boers were also convinced that god favored them and that setbacks were only a test of faith \\nit was at this moment of indecision that a popular lawyer named andries pretorius answered the trekker call for reinforcements and rode into camp with  men and a brass cannon the boers appointed him commander in chief on november  and he immediately began preparing a strike against the zulu \\nhis means were few a force of only about  boers including three scotsmen set out on november  seeking battle for extra protection the boer column of  wagons traveled four abreast instead of the usual single file each night they formed a circular defensive formation known as a laager \\npretorius realized that even with two frontloading cannon his force was too weak to defeat the zulu army in an open field he therefore decided to draw the enemy into an attack on the boer encampment each day patrols and scouting parties rode ahead sometimes led by pretorius himself to make sure no unexpected surprises were waiting over the horizon \\non december   the boer party reached the zandspruit tributary of the waschbank river it was here that the boer chaplain sarel cilliers first pledged during his nightly sermon that if god helped them defeat the zulus they and their descendents would celebrate that day in honor of god and that they would build a church in commemoration the boers repeated this oath known in afrikaner folklore as the covenant every night until they met the enemy \\nthere appeared to be no movement from the zulu side on december  pretorius decided to move camp to the buffalo river hoping to provoke the zulus by moving farther into their territory that day he sent out two patrols one under the command of his deputy commandant hans de lange and another under the scotsman edward parker this latter group saw action when they came upon a small group of zulus they killed the warriors and took the women prisoner \\npretorius drew up a message for dingaan on a white cloth explaining that he was leading a commando to punish the zulus if however dingaan was willing to cooperate pretorius wrote he was still willing to make peacea generous offer in light of the earlier betrayal he freed the prisoners and told them to give the message to dingaan he received no answer \\non december  the boers spotted zulus and what appeared to be a large number of cattle near their camp piet uys had been tricked by such a ploy at the battle of italeni zulu warriors crouching behind toughened animalskin shields looked like cattle from a distance and uys dropped his guard he was killed in a surprise attack by the cattle \\npretorius did not make the same mistake and he sent a strong mounted unit to investigate the cattle they turned out to be zulus and in the short fight that followed the boers killed eight warriors but suffered no casualties pretorius now suspected that the zulus were preparing for battle \\non december  he moved the boer camp to a position alongside the ncome river itself a tributary of the buffalo river a scouting expedition that day confirmed the presence of two huge zulu armies a short distance away \\npretorius prepared for battle his men drew the wagons into a dshaped formation one side overlooking a large hippopotamus path facing the ncome river another side facing a soil erosion ditch and the third side facing the open plain pretorius chose the site to limit the directions from which the zulus could attack \\nthe laager was large enough to contain all the horses and oxen the defenders tied the wagons together with leather ropes and closed off all openings between and below the wagons with a pretorius innovation socalled fighting gates which were slatted wood fixtures through which defenders could fire they left two small openings sealed with removable fighting gates so cavalry could leave the laager finally they attached lanterns to the ends of large oxwhips planted upright in the ground these dangled in front of the laager and were to serve as forward lighting during the dark hours when zulu usually attacked zulus captured after the battle said they had believed the lights waving in the breeze above the boer camp were spirits and that fear of the spirits kept them from attacking that night \\nbattle is joined \\nin pretoriuss own account of the battle he wrote that as the mist cleared on the morning of december  he saw that the boer camp was completely encircled by tens of thousands of zulu warriors even where the terrain would have made an attack difficult estimates placed the number of zulus at between  and  although no official count was possible whatever the figure pretorius wrote that it was a terrible sight \\nthe boers had been ready and armed since two hours before daybreak the two cannon were in position and the fighting gates closed the defenders expected to run out of ammunition for the cannon and had stacked up suitably sized stones at strategic points along the perimeter to fire as a last resort the boers would fire stones that day \\nthe front lines of the zulu force were still squatting only about  paces from the wagons waiting for the signal to attack pretorius decided to strike first at his signal three bursts of fire from the boer guns and two blasts from the cannon broke the silence the boers orders were to then hold their fire as the billows of gunpowder smoke lifted they saw that the surviving zulus had fled some  paces from their former front line leaving behind dozens of dying and dead comrades \\nthe boers then heard the noise of the zulus breaking their spear shafts to make them into short stabbing weapons a frontal assault was coming a few minutes later the zulu force stormed the wagons screaming wildly shields held high and assegais in readiness withering gunfire ripped through the zulu ranks and while some managed to reach the wagons they were gunned down before they could cut through the wagon canvasses \\nanother group of zulus tried to attack from inside the erosion ditch by standing on each others shoulders and scrambling over the edge pretorius ordered cilliers the fighting churchman to see off the attack he led a group of men out of the relative safety of the wagon perimeter and they proceeded to kill some  zulus one boer philip fourie was wounded when an assegai struck him in the side \\nthe boers then wheeled one of their cannon out of the laager pointed it into the ditch and fired a shot that literally blew apart the assaulting party the survivors fled the ditch in disarray this sparked a temporary retreat by the zulu and marked the end of the second unsuccessful attempt to break the boer lines the wounded boer fourie returned to the wagon circle for treatment \\nas the zulus waited for new orders pretorius ordered another burst of cannon fire into their ranks provoking a spontaneous charge against the wagons although it was the longest single assault of the ninehour battle it was utterly defeated as the boers cut down wave after wave of attackers gun barrels got so hot men had to hold them with wet cloths for reloading \\nas the third attack fell back the boers launched their first surprise counterattack as the mobile fighting gates swung open and a cavalry unit charged the zulu lines shooting from the saddle the boers tried to turn the zulu lines to their left desperate zulu resistance which saw hundreds more of their number killed stopped the encircling action and the boer horsemen rode back to the wagons they regrouped and launched a second attempt driving the zulus further away a third mounted charge finally broke through the zulu lines the boer cavalry then turned and attacked the zulus from the rear pinned between the cavalry and cannon fire from within the wagon circle the main zulu force facing the open plain scattered \\na reserve zulu force tried to cross the ncome river to attack the laager but so many warriors were gunned down that their blood stained the water red pretorius himself then led another cavalry charge from within the laager cut to pieces with thousands dead the zulu army which had courageously charged repeatedly against a betterarmed enemy finally broke ranks and fled \\npretorius divided his cavalry into two units and sent them in pursuit mounted boers killed hundreds of warriors during a threehour chase it was during this pursuit that pretorius was wounded two other boers including fourie suffered nonfatal assegai wounds but these were the only boer casualties an estimated  zulus died on the battlefield and many more died later from wounds \\nthe aftermath \\nearly the next morning pretorius ordered the camp broken and marched the commando straight to the zulu kings capital he was confident the zulus no longer posed any significant threat but he hardly expected the sight that awaited him on december  at umgungundhlovo dingaan had fled with his wives and cattle leaving the circular camp of reed huts burning as a symbol of the destruction of zulu power \\non the outskirts of the capital the boers found the skeletons of retief and his men their hands and feet were still bound fast with thongs of ox hide wrote cilliers and in nearly all the corpses a spike as thick as an arm had been forced into the anus so that the point of the spike was in the chest retief who was identified by the remains of a satin vest he had worn still had a leather bag draped over his shoulder bone in it was the treaty signed by dingaan giving the boers the unoccupied land to the north according to one of the boers who saw it the treaty was astonishingly well preservedas if it had been left in a closed box pretoriuss men buried retief and his party on christmas day  \\ndingaan fled north but was captured by a rival tribe the swazis earlier he had persecuted the swazis and they murdered him in revenge the new zulu king mpande was officially installed in  and confirmed the contents of the treaty with the boers who established their first republic in southern africa also in  in fulfillment of their covenant the boers built a church to mark the blood river victory \\nthe battle of blood river entered the afrikaner psyche as a divinelyinspired victory and december  became a public holiday in south africa celebrated each year with festivals church services and reenactments the battle represented the victory of european civilization over the darkness of africa of christianity over heathens it helped justify white supremacy and the selfappointed right of afrikaners to rule over not apart from the black tribes \\nyet the battle of blood river in many ways symbolized all that was wrong with the white settlement of southern africa and why that experiment failed the boers are to be praised for wanting to settle unoccupied land peacefully and for seeking the friendship of neighboring peoples but neither they nor their descendents understood that demography is the arbiter of nations those who form the majority population of a territory will rule that territory no matter how powerful a ruling elite may be they will determine its culture and society a majorityeuropean population will create a society that reflects european values and norms a majorityafrican population will create a society that reflects african norms \\nthe boers never understood this even at the battle of blood river they had at least  black servants and an indeterminate number of mixedrace servants who helped load weapons parker one of the scotsman had more than  black servants \\nto the present day the overwhelming majority of afrikaners have black servants who work on farms in factories and in homes afrikaners failed to understand that by giving the native population the benefits of european civilization blacks would grow in numbers and overwhelm their society the cape colony and the original boer republics which were largely uninhabited by natives when they were settled by europeans are today home to tens of millions of africans \\nthe church of the vow built by the boers in  still stands in the town of pietermaritzburg named after piet retief but pietermaritzburg supposedly the symbol of the boer victory over the zulus is today part of a municipality called umgungundhlovo named after dingaans capital it is also the capital of the south african province of kwazulu natal and its population is more than  percent black \\nthe church of the vow stands alone graffitiscarred and abandoned in a dirty downtown slum its decay illustrates the fatal error made by the victors of the battle of blood river that of ignoring the demographics of race if whites had taken possession of those unoccupied lands and kept them for themselves alone the history of south africa would have been entirely different \\nif the boers had inhabited and worked their own land rather than rely on black labor the states they created might still be strong and independent today their decision to use nonwhite labor was a critical error that undid all of the sacrifices of the early pioneers \\nthe only way to maintain a civilization is for the majority to occupy its own land with its own people and to do its own manual labor this law governs the rise and fall of civilizations and the victors of blood river ignored it to their cost',\n",

often assured is racist elect a black president and will it make a difference \\never since hillary clinton dropped out of the race the polls have reported consistently that barack obama will beat john mccain the media love to tell us that whites say they support the black candidate and then vote for the white but there is no reason for whites to lie in this campaign mr obama will not get a majority of the white vote but he will get enough to beat mr mccain why will so many whites vote for mr obama \\nfirst some support his policies they want to end the war in iraq and they want the standard liberal program of socialized medicine higher taxes more handouts and more government there has always been a substantial minority of whites who vote this way and they have a clear favorite in mr obama \\nsecond as many people have pointed out an enormous number of whites think it is deeply virtuous to vote for a blacknot for an outandout race man such as jesse jackson or al sharpton but for an unthreatening wellscrubbed black who speaks standard english and promises to bring us together even if they live sharply segregated lives whites thrill to the language of coming together and they adore blacks who dont act or sound black \\nfor many whites voting for mr obama will be an act of high patriotism electing him will prove america is not racist and many whites believe that rising above racism is americas sacred calling one must never underestimate the importance to whites of feeling virtuous most would rather lose a leg than be thought a bigot and a vote for obama is a painless way to burnish antiracist credentials \\nthird young whites will line up for mr obama they have been swallowing antiwhite multiculti propaganda all their lives and have not knocked around enough to discover it is false some who know their parents will vote for mr mccain will make a special point of voting for mr obama every new generation thinks it is cooler hipper and wiser than any generation that ever lived and what could be cooler hipper or wiser than putting a black man in the white house for many young whites a vote for mr obama will be a denial of every uncool unhip and especially every even faintly racerealist thing their parents ever said or did \\nfourth although the country seems to have a collective memory of no more than two weeks americans think everything is historic whenever someone breaks an obscure record in professional baseball we are told history was made if you ask someone why he waited in line all night to buy the first apple iphone he will tell you its a historic product americans love anything that is historic and for people who think a few more stolen bases are history right up there with the battle of lepanto putting a black man in the white house will be the discovery of america pearl harbor and the second coming all rolled into one many whites will vote for mr obama because they want to think they helped make history \\nthe media which has its own grim reasons for supporting mr obama is mesmerized by the same prospect editors salivate at the thought of writing headlines like history is made the day after the election and some will lose all selfcontrol and add an exclamation mark the emphasis of course will be on mr obama as the first black president implying more to come the media which always subtly boost the democrat will be even more blatantly partisan this time downplaying every blunder mr obama makes and highlighting mr mccains \\nfifth many whites will vote for mr obamaor at least not vote for mr mccainbecause the republicans have nominated the most stunningly unattractive candidate in years old and pockmarked mr mccain is thoroughly disliked in the senate for arrogance that he cannot even hide from voters when he is not speaking from notes he has dismayed republicans by promoting amnesty for illegals and dismayed everyone else by saying america should stay in iraq for  years if it takes that long to win mr obama therefore has the enormous advantage of running against an opponent that not even republicans like \\nmr obama will also crush mr mccain in facetoface debates mr mccain cannot put an unscripted sentence together any better than george w bush can and will come across as a thickwitted geezer mr obama who is as glib as any politician gives credence to hl menckens definition of democracy as rule by orators \\nbut what about americas storied racism isnt america brimming with people who cant bear the thought of a black president americans have been numbed for decades by attractive televisionblacks who read the news forecast the weather and tell us which brand of toothpaste to buy americans get a steady diet of heroic movieblacks who outsmart and beat up white brutes solve baffling technical problems dispense sage advice and save the world even the current miss usa is black there are millions of whites who do not want to live with blacks or have much to do with them but would a black president be much different from nearly eight years of black secretaries of state the march of blackness may be vaguely worrying to whites but they think there is nothing they can do about it and that they shouldnt even if they could \\nthe final reason why whites will vote for mr obama is that the republicans do not have the backbone to attack him in the only way that would work if they were serious they would fill the airways with jeremiah wright prancing and raving along with the message this is the man who married mr and mrs obama baptized their children and whom mr obama calls a family member they would buy radio ads quoting michelle obamas thesis in which she says she will always be black first and american second mr mccain has nothing like the stomach for a campaign like this \\nmany blacks probably think he has the stomach for considerably worse  percent think mr obama is in greater physical danger than any white politician and many say they would have warned him not to run for fear he would be killed an assassination would certainly be a shattering event there is no telling how many cities would go up in flames and thirdworld countries which have followed the obama nomination with unprecedented interest would help make it the most widely reported killing in history i have just returned from a muslim country in which everyone has heard of mr obama and likes him but most have never heard of john mccain whatever gruesome fantasies blacks may be spinning however assassination has gone out of style in america and white resistancesuch as it isis dependably nonviolent mr obama will be perfectly safe \\nin any case mr obama will win far more white votes than he will lose because he is black whites who dont want a black president would not vote for a democrat anyway as for black voters even nominal republicans are said to be running for the doors but strictly racial voting has always been fine for blacks not so for whites of course just try telling your coworkers that you disagree with mr mccain but are voting for him because he is white \\nracially conscious whites will be in a quandary in november even if mr mccains policies are worse than mr obamas should they vote for the white manone with an adopted bangladeshi daughter and who long ago betrayed white interests even after years of being softened up with black heroes and figureheads a black in the white house is a powerful symbol of white dispossession a mulatto president is an almost explicit endorsement of miscegenation this is bitter medicine \\nsome whites have argued that a black president would undercut the charges of racism whites are forever facing but they are dreaming the entire government could look like a meeting of the mystic knights of the sea but as long as blacks are worse off than whites we will be blamed for it sensible whites cannot cheerfully vote for either man i suspect most will stay home or vote for a minor candidate \\naside from the symbolic impact which cannot be calculated will president obama be much different from a president hillary clinton she would lard her cabinet with blacks and hispanics nominate ultraliberal judges push for amnesty grovel before nonwhites everywhere and load up the civil rights division of the justice department with antiwhite sharks she would certainly make a bigger fool of herself over hispanics and asians see  turning up the pressure  ar may  our choice therefore could not be more disagreeable on balance we get to decide which is the more degrading spectacle deluded white people giving their country away or cleareyed blacks helping themselves to it \\npresident obama will however face special pressures he cant let the pushier brothers walk all over him but he will have to throw them enough bones to keep them off his back it will be a tricky balance mr obamas first annual address to the naacp will be a love feast but every year after that it will be harder to explain why black unemployment poverty and incarceration rates havent changed at all \\neven mr obamas starstruck white supporters will eventually wonder what happened to all that change he promised there is not going to be change the system is far too stuck in its selfserving ways for that with the help of an enlarged democratic majority in congress mr obama may set up some wheezing byzantine form of socialized medicine but no one will be happy with it if mr obama inherits a sick economy a weak dollar expensive oil and shrinking revenues americans will not at all like the change they get \\non the bright side with mr obama we have a good chance of piquant firstlady behavior what will the white house be like with michelle in charge will she want a new exterior paint job how and whom will she entertain will the big mans guest bedroomsin the african traditionbe turned over to third cousins from kenya and the south side of chicago there is no telling with what improprieties large and small

mccarran international airport lucky dragon guests are confirmed to be on that flight jacoby said \\nalready a record  visitors from china traveled to las vegas last year nearly double the number in  according to the las vegas convention and visitors authority \\nmeanwhile ground was broken on another asianthemed resort this one much bigger than lucky dragon resorts world a malaysian hospitality and casino giant with decades of asian gaming experience is spending up to  billion for a room property on the north strip that will feature chinese architecture such as an ersatz great wall its slated to open in  \\nplans are also underway to build a billion resort on the strip called alon las vegas the project is owned by australias crown resort who count chinese gamers as a major source of business \\nits going to be even more of a competitive market said john decree an analyst at union gaming in las vegas everyones coming for the same customer its going to be a challenge with  rooms the hotel is small compared with many on the strip but with five restaurants it offers more dining options than many its size isaac brekken  for the times \\ncompetition could also be fierce for chinese high rollers whose gambling activity has been curtailed by a slowing chinese economy and an anticorruption campaign at home that until recently sent macau gambling revenues into a twoyear slump \\nlas vegas isnt immune to those headwinds after years of explosive growth casinos on the strip experienced a decline in the amount of money bet on baccarat to about  billion in  thats nearly  billion less than  according to the nevada gaming control board \\nthe casino industry uses the card game as a proxy for chinese gambling activity because of its massive popularity within the culture thats both for practical and superstitious reasons baccarat has the best statistical odds of beating the house compared with other games and as a game of chance over skill baccarat also plays into chinese fatalistic attitudes toward luck \\nthe vast majority of baccarat play comes from the asian market said jacoby of lucky dragon \\njacobys casino will offer seven vip baccarat tables on a secondfloor terrace with access to a vast menu of authentic chinese food in addition to live seafood flown in from all over the world the property will serve staples like congee wonton noodles and dim sum \\nfood is expected to be a big draw because chinese vacationers overwhelmingly prefer their native cuisine over others \\nlas vegas has a number of wellregarded chinese restaurants such as ping pang pong at gold coast hotel  casino china mama in chinatown and an outpost of chengdu taste the san gabriel valley stalwart for sichuan cuisine highend chinese food is also served at highroller rooms such as the venetians paiza club \\nno casino however boasts the concentration of chinese restaurants that lucky dragon will with five altogether the hope is chinese tourists staying at other properties will choose to eat  and gamble  at lucky dragon when they venture off the strip \\nthe emphasis on food means lucky dragons owners can eschew things that arent particularly important to chinese tourists like a whiskey bar or nightclub and because chinese tourists often dont like to sunbathe lucky dragons pool isnt much bigger than the backyard variety \\njacoby says his competitors on the strip offer chinese gamers a diluted experience by operating a handful of chinese restaurants and parlors in megacasinos that have to serve all manner of people not just chinese by comparison visitors to lucky dragon can start conversing in mandarin with staff as soon as they walk in he said \\nwere trying to take the asian gaming experience and bring that front and center instead of hiding the most valuable customer in a segregated portion of a large building jacoby said \\nthough lucky dragon will rely heavily on asian american customers at first its funding was largely drawn from mainland chinese investors through the federal eb visa program the visa allows foreigners and their immediate family to gain permanent us residency in exchange for a minimum investment of  that also creates american jobs rather than focusing on bars and nightclubs the casino is prioritizing dining options that includes a tea room still under construction isaac brekken  for the times \\nchinese investors have dominated the program nationwide accounting for  of applicants awaiting eb visas though occasionally subject to fraud the program has successfully funded a handful of mixedused projects in new york the jw marriott hotel at la live and the sls hotel  casino across from lucky dragon \\njacoby declined to say how many chinese investors are involved in lucky dragon which is expected to employ  people jacoby also declined to disclose how much the project cost adding that earlier media reports pegging the price tag at about  million were inaccurate \\nthe company hit a snag last year when it unsuccessfully sought tax subsidies from the city but financial commitments from weidners family and others put the project back on track \\nlucky dragon isnt the first las vegas resort to target a specific demographic the hard rock hotel  casino and the palms casino resort opened years ago catering to young partygoers and clubbers before eventually being overshadowed by larger competitors on the strip such as the mgm grand and the cosmopolitan \\nlucky dragons early backers even considered building an lgbt resort before settling on their current strategy one they say will live and die on being able to deliver an authentic chinese gambling experience \\nwe set out trying to put together a place that would stand alone in shanghai if you dropped it off down there today jacoby said we didnt want to have just gongs asian tapestries and caricaturestuff like that',\n",

substantially increased its gold holdings \\naccording to the business insider  \\nin july of this year the central bank of russia added  ounces of gold to its reserves the onemonth uptick in russian gold reserves   ounces  is approximately equal to the entire annual output of barrick golds turquoise ridge gold mine in nevada \\nat that same rate   ounces per month  in a mere five months russia would add to state gold reserves the equivalent of the entire annual output of barricks massive goldstrike mine in nevada \\ncurrently russian gold reserves rank seventh in the world its clear that there is a concerted effort by russian authorities to build up the countrys gold reserves as part of a national strategy to negate the effects of economic warfare waged by the united states \\nrickards in his  book currency wars theorized that russia and china could combine their gold reserves to form a global goldbacked currency to compete against the us dollar currently russian reserves stand at roughly  tonnes with chinese reserves totaling over  tonnes according to china  its likely more which would amount to a combined total of roughly  tonnes of gold \\nthe us is about to lose overarching control of policymaking within the international monetary fund imf thus the us lockup on global gold is about to vanish according to business insider \\nimagine for a moment the distinctly real possibility that russianchinese alliance could exercise indirect or even direct control over the imfs gold reserve of over  tonnes russian chinese and imf gold combined would equal roughly  tonnes and would allow for direct competition with the us gold reserves estimated at  tonnes \\nrussia and china have realized that the petrodollar is wielded by washington as its weapon of choice when opposing a wellarmed state and clearly see the writing on the wall  thus working together to create a new global financial paradigm \\nthe reality is that the united states is  trillion dollars in debt and eventually the time will come when the us economy begins to implode  and all the fiat currency people are stuck holding will essentially be worth nothing more than the paper its printed on hard assets such as gold and silver should be bought and taken custody of while there is still an opportunity to do so as a means of hedging against the potentially disastrous results of the us using the petrodollar as a weapon \\nultimately the united states russia and china are all controlled by centralized powerhungry tyrants attempting to command powerful global bureaucracies like the imf the world bank swift new development bank and the asian infrastructure investment bank \\nits not russian nuclear weapons that people should fear as the policy of mutually assured destruction essentially voids any benefit of a state launching a firststrike nuclear attack the true threat to america is our economic house of cards built upon the back of a neoliberal trade policy that puts the rights of corporations over that of people  \\nthis article was written by jay syrmopoulos and originally published at the free thought project',\n",

workforce \\nthe industrial robotics industry is logging record sales worldwide and there appears to be no sign of a slowdown as you can see in the graphic below  sales surged  over a previous record year to reach almost  million units \\nthere are many factors driving this growth which you can read about here but one point worth noting is that the two leading countries are the us and china with china leading the way \\nthe nature of robotics is also changing as new developments in artificial intelligence are giving robots an increasing range of potential uses one key area of course is security robot security guards have already begun appearing at prisons  care facilities  and schools in various locations around the world \\none us robot company gamma  robotics has designed several models for mass production their latest  ramsee  can be seen in the video below a true mass rollout of this fully autonomous security guard could significantly impact the  million humans that are currently employed in some form of security patrol \\nramsee advertises the following capabilities is a physical presence that autonomously patrols without supervision provides realtime data intruders motion heat fire smoke gases  more is a humanmachine interface that creates a powerful force multiplier \\nsignificantly gamma  robotics has partnered with hexagon safety  infrastructure the global leader in public safety and security solutions \\nhowever ramsee is missing one thing weapons for that we have to travel to china where they seem to have embraced police robots full throttle \\nin late  i covered an announcement from chinas xinhua news agency where they announced the development and deployment of  weaponized antiterrorism robots that would be far more active than a mere patrol \\nthe toysized robots can coordinate with each other on the battlefield said the report following their unveiling at the  world robot conference in beijing \\nthe first model is known as a reconnaissance robot which scouts for poisonous gases dangerous chemicals and explosives before transmitting its findings back to baseif this initial investigation detects a simple bomb is the source of danger the second robot model  a small explosive ordnance disposal eod machine  would be sent in to diffuse it \\nbut with other more complicated threats an attacker robot would start its mission armed with minorcaliber weapons recoilless rifles and grenade launchers \\nwith a sighting telescope a trigger and a safe installed the attacker can hit its target from a long distance xinhua said \\nthe local police force in beijing was reported to be among the buyers for the three robots  which are priced at  million yuan  for the set by manufacturers hit robot group who are based in the northern city of harbin \\napart from antiterror operations they can also be applied in fire fighting public security forestry and agriculture the companys sales manager chen deqiang said according to xinhua \\nif we have learned anything about antiterrorism efforts authorities consider frontline deployment to be areas of public travel we were given the tsa based on such notions and have since witnessed its intrusive role in airports and soontobe at other public transportation if authorities have their way \\nchina has gone to the next level with a robot tsa of sorts called anbot that is equipped with what is essentially a taserlike device that is being fittingly compared to a cattleprod \\nimage credit \\nit was first introduced at a tech show earlier in the year and was speculated to have been designed for protest suppression for now its first job is to patrol chinas shenzhen airport \\nmost alarming however is that it is tied to one of the most powerful supercomputers on the planet \\nthe back end of this intelligent security robot is l inked to chinas tianhe supercomputer  where it has access to cloud services  anbot conducts patrols recognizes threats and has multiple cameras that use facial recognition \\nthese cloud services give the robots petascale processing power  well beyond onboard processing capabilities in the robot the supercomputer connection is there to enhance the intelligent learning capabilities and humanmachine interface of these devices said the uschina economic and security review in a report released tuesday that examines chinas autonomous systems development efforts  emphasis added \\n source  \\nthis link to cloud services is a new trend in robot artificial intelligence that also has been referred to as the wikipedia for robots  essentially an internet cloud brain through robottorobot information sharing they can speed up their learning process  autonomously examples have included robots that can learn to cook and robots that can learn the tasks involved in caregiving however when applied to policing things become much more ethically troubling \\npeople were outraged in the us for example when a robot in dallas was used to deliver a pound of c explosive to a us citizen whom the police deemed a sufficient threat worthy of immediate execution at least in that case a human made the decision but it is being viewed as a tiptoe along the path to the widespread use of killer robots much as we have seen with the use of drones discussion was once limited to overseas  egregious enough  but there has been a growing voice of those who are urging weaponized domestic police drones \\nas john vibes wrote  it might be inevitable \\nthe taser corporation is planning on building a drone that is equipped with a stun gun according to a recent report by the wall street journal \\nnot only will the drones be equipped with tasers but there is also talk of them being autonomous meaning that an actual human wont necessarily be needed to fly the drone \\nthis is actually already being done in india  the first country to have approved the use of drones attached with nonlethal weapons and just this week british tabloid the sun  had a feature entitled vladimir putins russia is preparing an army of robots and drones to take on its enemies deputy pm dmitry rogozin admits given the available facts this title no longer seems so deliberately sensational \\nclearly we are entering a potentially dangerous convergence of expanding robotic artificial intelligence along with the political will to continue allowing robots more and more autonomy as they carry out the traditional duties of the military and police some experts argue that the precision of robotics will curb many of the abuses we have seen from our military and police but is that the trend we are actually seeing or will automated systems of violent control inevitably lead to even greater industriallevel suppression and killing \\nnicholas west

grenada representatives to discuss their ufo resolution ambassador petree acknowledged the high level of interest in ufos among some elements of the private sector and scientific community  and pointed to the budgetary impact as a major concern of the us and other countries \\non nov   the day after our presentation at the un this document was sent through official channels detailing the actual ufo event describing what each of the invited scientific and military speakers had to say to the member nations \\na few days after that on dec   a followup cable was transmitted including the following \\nsubsequent to the introduction of the grenadian ufo resolution misoff mission officer has engaged in two separate informal negotiating sessions which included representation from austria ussr and grenada in an attempt to arrive at a mutually acceptable compromise solution to the problem \\na draft decision to be taken by the special political committee spc has been agreed upon by the participants in the informal negotiations subject to concurrence of their respective capitals we think referral of the ufo matter to the outer space committee osc without a preordained mandate as to what action is to be taken provides the flexibility the osc needs to take whatever action it deems appropriate \\nit will also obviate the need to vote on a resolution and gamble on the results \\nthe following week brought forth another document  on dec   which stated \\nthe general assembly invites interested member states to take appropriate steps to coordinate on a national level scientific research and investigation into extraterrestrial life including unidentified flying objects and to inform the secretarygeneral of the observations research and evaluation of such activities \\nit was further suggested that grenadas views on ufos could be discussed in  unfortunately that didnt come to pass as grenada prime minister gairy was overthrown in a  coup \\nneedless to say without the gairybased initiative on ufos it was quietly relegated to grenadas back burner \\nthis is the tip of the ufoun iceberg it shows how the subject of ufos wasnt merely officially ridiculed or slapped aside there was and perhaps still is some interest there just waiting to emerge',\n",

knowing what i do i would not do it again i would try to figure another way \\nwaco didnt make her hesitant it made her insistent about getting her own information observes walter dellinger who served in two top justice department jobs under reno \\ndellinger believes for instance that it may have been the waco experience that led reno to go personally to miami in april  to see if there was a way to avoid a forcible removal of yearold cuban refugee elián gonzález from the home of a greatuncle so the boy could be returned to his only living parent in cuba \\nelián had been rescued at sea after his mother and eight others drowned trying to get to the united states rescued by fishermen and brought to the us he was soon turned over to his greatuncle the cuban community in miami was in an uproar over the idea of returning the boy to his father who lived in cuba and the furor soon bled over to congress \\nbut when negotiations with the greatuncle failed armed federal agents acting on renos orders raided the home removed elián and turned him over to his father who had come to the us to receive his son when the us supreme court refused to intervene the two returned to their home in cuba \\njanet reno takes the oath as attorney general during a ceremony at the white house on march   while president bill clinton watches \\nbarry thummaap \\nover the course of time reno would become embroiled in many controversies she sought the appointment of a series of independent counsels to investigate four fellow cabinet members and president clinton himself but she refused to authorize an independent counsel investigation of contributions to the clintongore campaign after justice department lawyers concluded no crime had been committed by either the president or vice president \\nthe decision so infuriated republicans that some called for her impeachment this is the most politicized justice department in the history of the united states railed dan burton the republican chairman of a key house oversight committee \\nat  feet  inches however reno stood tall in the political crosswinds gorelick observes that when members of congress like burton were unhappy with a government official they threatened to call that official to testify but reno who had served as a staffer in the florida state legislature always said fine ill be there as a result says gorelick eventually all those who were threatening her with a hearing stopped doing that because she prevailed in every outing that i can recall  she just went in there and laid out her views and bested those who would challenge her \\nthe controversies that the justice department faced during renos reign often eclipsed the many things that went well the quick apprehension and successful prosecution of the oklahoma city bombers for example the pursuit of bombers of womens health clinics that provide abortions and the solving of the socalled unabomber case \\nafter nearly two decades of fruitless pursuit the fbi still had no idea as to the identity of the man dubbed the unabomber who had killed three people and injured  then in  the bomber sent a letter to the new york times offering to cease his terror campaign if the times or the washington post would publish his word manifesto against modern industry and technology neither newspaper was inclined to do that initially but reno the daughter of two newspaper journalists persuaded the newspaper owners to jointly publish the essay in the interests of public safety \\nit paid off the unabombers brother recognized the style and ideas in the essay and tipped off the fbi ending the bombers long reign of terror theodore kaczynski aka the unabomber is now serving a life term in a maximum security federal prison \\nin  reno was diagnosed with parkinsons disease she did not slow down but her hands sometimes shook so hard you could hear them knocking against the table at a congressional hearing she even joked about the disease claiming that shaking sometimes helps as in playing a steel drum or balancing her kayak \\nthat combination of toughness and selfdeprecating humor plus her determination to protect the justice department from improper influence made her a hero to many who worked for her \\njanet reno led with her values says former deputy attorney general gorelick the departments no  official and that meant that if she decided that a certain path was the right thing to do the people around her believed her and would charge up any hill behind her  id never seen that before in quite the same way \\nflorida gubernatorial candidate and former us attorney general janet reno speaks at the florida democratic party state conference on april   in lake buena vista fla she lost the democratic primary \\nreno won enormous respect inside the department as well because of her work ethic and dedication to understanding issues in the many parts of the justice department  from national security to environmental questions to the generally obscure field of indian law \\nus attorney general loretta lynch called her one of the most effective decisive and wellrespectedleaders in the departments proud history who never shied from criticism or shirked responsibility and former attorney general eric holder said that in a city where too many compromise their values for short term political gain janet reno stood out as a person of integrity and of enduring values \\nformer solicitor general dellinger believes that reno was prepared for the attorney generals job early in life by her intellect and ungainly height this is a woman that went to cornell and harvard law school at a time when very few women went to harvard law school went through junior high and high school being twice as tall as anybody else and probably twice as smart  and thats really really tough \\nthere were of course ups and downs in the eight years of renos reign but she said she always took the long view of her job \\nif the end brings me out right what people said about me wont make any difference and if the end brings me out wrong  angels saying i was right wont make any difference she said in an interview with npr in  \\npresident clinton made little secret of his frequent displeasure with reno and the wall of separation she erected between the justice department and the white house still he never asked her to resign reno was the last cabinet member he reappointed after his reelection in  \\nit was actually quite wonderful said dellinger she just decided to stay and it turns out that nobody could fire her \\nthe tension between clinton and his attorney general was apparent even as clintons time in office drew to a close in an interview with cbs news  minutes  clinton went out of his way to praise friends and foes alike but when it came to his evaluation of reno he was tepid to say the least \\ngood woman he said tried really hard to do a good job shes a good person \\nat least he didnt say i was a bad person replied reno with a laugh ill take what i can get \\nindeed by the end of her tenure janet reno had outlasted her critics and earned such a reputation for integrity and independence that comedian will ferrells parody of her became one of the iconic skits on nbcs saturday night live  the recurring skit was inspired by reports that reno had cut quite a figure dancing at a justice department party \\non the last episode of the janet renos dance party parody ferrell wearing a blue dress and pearls reminisces about past glories and laments that the end of the party

british swans and can fire the entire australian government \\nits true that her role as the british head of state is largely ceremonial and the monarch no longer holds any serious power from day to day the historic prerogative powers of the sovereign have been devolved largely to government ministers but this still means that when the british government declares war or regulates the civil service or signs a treaty it is doing so only on her authority \\nand she still wields some of these prerogative powers herself  as well as numerous other unique powers ranging from the surprising to the utterly bizarre \\nmost famously she owns all swans in the river thames \\ntechnically all unmarked swans in open water belong to the queen though the crown exercises her ownership only on certain stretches of the thames and its surrounding tributaries according to the official website of the royal family \\ntoday this tradition is observed during the annual swan upping in which swans in the river thames are caught ringed and set free again as part of census of the swan population \\nits a highly ceremonial affair taking place over five days swan uppers wear traditional uniforms and row upriver in six skiffs accompanied by the queens swan marker \\nthe swans are also given a health check and ringed with individual identification numbers by the queens swan warden a professor of ornithology at the university of oxfords department of zoology according to the royal family website \\nrule britannia britannia rules the waves goes a classic british song  and this rule extends beneath the waves too the sovereign has dominion over a variety of aquatic animals in british waters \\nthe queen still technically owns all the sturgeons whales and dolphins in the waters around england and wales in a rule that dates back to a statute from  during the reign of king edward ii according to time \\naccording to the article this statute is still valid today and sturgeons porpoises whales and dolphins are recognised as fishes royal when they are captured within  miles about  km of uk shores or wash ashore they may be claimed on behalf of the crown generally when brought into port a sturgeon is sold in the usual way and the purchaser as a gesture of loyalty requests the honour of its being accepted by elizabeth \\nthe law is still observed in  a welsh fisherman was investigated by the police after catching a foot sturgeon the bbc reported at the time the scottish government also issued guidance on the law in  writing that the right to claim royal fish in scotland allows the scottish government on behalf of the crown to claim stranded whales which are too large to be drawn to land by a wain pulled by six oxen \\nthe queen can drive without a licence \\ndriving licenses are issued in the queens name yet she is the only person in the united kingdom who doesnt legally need a license to drive or a number plate on her cars according to time \\ndespite not being required to have a license the queen is comfortable behind the wheel having learned to drive during world war ii when she operated a firstaid truck for the womens auxillary territorial service as a result of the queens training she can also change a spark plug time notes \\nqueen elizabeth ii isnt afraid to show off her driving skills either in  she surprised king abdullah of saudi arabia then still a prince by driving him around in her country seat of balmoral \\nformer british ambassador sherard cowpercoles recounted the meeting in the sunday times as instructed the crown prince climbed into the front seat of the front land rover with his interpreter in the seat behind to his surprise the queen climbed into the driving seat turned the ignition and drove off women are not  yet  allowed to drive in saudi arabia and abdullah was not used to being driven by a woman let alone a queen \\ncowpercoles continued his nervousness only increased as the queen an army driver in wartime accelerated the land rover along the narrow scottish estate roads talking all the time through his interpreter the crown prince implored the queen to slow down and concentrate on the road ahead \\nunlike other members of the royal family the queen does not require a passport as they are issued in her name despite this lack of travel documents she has been abroad many times \\nshe has two birthdays \\nwhen youre the british head of state one birthday just isnt enough the queens official birthday is celebrated on a saturday in june though her actual birthday is on april  \\nofficial celebrations to mark a sovereigns birthday have often been held on a day other than the actual birthday particularly when the actual birthday has not been in the summer according to the royal mint \\nboth birthdays are celebrated in suitable style too her actual birthday is marked publicly by gun salutes in central london at midday according to the official website of the british monarchy this includes a gun salute in hyde park a gun salute in windsor great park and a gun salute at the tower of london in  her majesty celebrated her th birthday in  with a walkabout in the streets outside of windsor castle to meet wellwishers \\nfor her official birthday celebrations meanwhile she is joined by other members of the royal family at the spectacular trooping the colour parade which moves between buckingham palace the mall and horseguards parade \\nshe has her own private cash machine \\nless a power and more a perk of the job a private cash machine for use by the royal family is installed in the basement of buckingham palace its provided by coutts one of britains most prestigious  and exclusive  banks \\nthe queen has her own personal poet \\nthe poet laureate is an honorary position in british society appointed by the monarch to a poet whose work is of national significance according to the official website of the british monarchy when first the role was introduced the appointee was paid  per year plus a butt of canary wine today the poet laureate is given a barrel of sherry \\ncarol ann duffy will hold the position until  \\nshe has to sign laws \\nthe queens consent is necessary to turn any bill into an actual law once a proposed law has passed both houses of parliament it makes its way to the palace for approval which is called royal assent the most recent british monarch to refuse to provide royal assent was queen anne back in  \\nroyal assent is different than queens consent in which the queen must consent to any law being debated in parliament that affects the monarchys interests such as reforming the prerogative or tax laws that might affect the duchy of cornwall for example without consent the bill cannot be debated in parliament \\nqueens consent is exercised only on the advice of ministers but its existence provides the government with a tool for blocking debate on certain subjects if bills are tabled by backbench rebels or the opposition \\nit has been exercised at least  times according to documents released under the freedom of information act including one instance in which the queen completely vetoed the military actions against iraq bill in  a private members bill that sought to transfer the power to authorise military strikes against iraq from the monarch to parliament the guardian reported in  \\nshe can create lords \\nthe queen has the power to appoint lords who can then sit in parliament the upper house in britains legislative system like many other powers this is exercised only on the advice of elected government ministers \\nshe doesnt have to pay tax but she does anyway \\nthe queen does not have to pay tax but she has been voluntarily paying income tax and capital gains tax since  \\nthe queen has the power to form governments \\nunlike the queen prime minister david cameron doesnt literally sit on a throne rob stothardgetty imageshbobi \\nthe queen previously wielded the power to dissolve parliament and call a general election but the fixedterm parliaments act put an end to that in  now a twothirds vote in the commons is required to dissolve parliament before a fiveyear fixedterm is up \\nshe does still play a part after an election however when she calls on the mp most able to form a government to do so \\nthis caused some worry ahead of this years general election it once looked as if the conservatives might not have a majority but would be the largest party and would try to form a government meanwhile it was feasible that labour could form a majority despite having fewer seats by entering into a coalition with multiple other parties \\nin this situation the queen would have been stuck between a rock and a hard place every year she opens parliament with the queens speech which lays out the governments plans but to give david camerons speech would arguably be to tacitly endorse his government  while staying away would send the opposite message \\nat one point the times was told by sources that she planned to stay away if cameron failed to secure enough mps but the palace later had an aboutface royal sources confirmed she would lead proceedings even if there was a risk the speech would be overthrown the following week because the tories had failed to muster enough backing from smaller parties the times subsequently reported \\nshe has knights \\nsure they no longer ride around on horseback wooing maidens with their tales of valour but britain still retains knights like lords they are appointed by the queen  and she knights them personally \\nknighthoods are typically given to figures who have made a particular contribution to british society  whether in business the arts the military or elsewhere after terry pratchett was knighted the legendary fantasy author forged himself a special sword using pieces of a meteorite \\nthe individuals knighted are decided by ministers the bbc reports who present her with a list of nominees each year for her approval \\nshe is exempt from freedom of information requests \\nall information about the royal family is exempt from freedom of information requests the exemption was made after a legal battle between the guardian and the government to have letters from prince charles sent to whitehall ministers made public the socalled black spider memos were recently released but the change means the same cant happen in the future \\nshe can ignore or overrule ministerial advice in grave constitutional crisis \\nwhile the overwhelming majority of the queens prerogative powers are devolved to her ministers there is one exception that allows her to wield power herself only in grave constitutional crisis the sovereign can act contrary to or without ministerial advice with no precedent in modern times its not clear what would actually constitute this but the possibility remains \\nthe queen holds the ability to fire the entire australian government \\nas the head of state in australia the queen has certain powers over the government in  for example the queens representative in the country at the time gov gen sir john kerr fired the prime minister in response to a government shutdown \\nkerr appointed a replacement who immediately passed the spending bill to fund the government max fisher wrote in the washington post three hours later kerr dismissed the rest of parliament then australia held elections to restart from scratch and they havent had another shutdown since \\nin addition to the uk and australia the queen is also the head of state in antigua and barbuda the bahamas barbados belize canada grenada jamaica new zealand papua new guinea saint kitts and nevis saint lucia saint vincent and the grenadines solomon islands and tuvalu \\nall the above are commonwealth realms or former british colonies the british sovereign retains the position she holds in the united kingdom that of head of state as in britain this is largely a ceremonial role from day to day \\nshes the head of a religion \\nqueen elizabeth ii is the head of the church of england britains state religion first established after king henry viii split away from the catholic church in rome in the th century \\nher formal title is defender of the faith and supreme governor of the church of england and she also has the power to appoint bishops and archbishops as with many of her other powers however this is exercised only on the advice of the prime minister who himself takes advice from a church commission \\nan interesting side effect of this is that the sovereign must be a confirmed member of church of england catholics and those of other religions may not ascend to the british throne if prince charles converted to islam for example he would be unable to become king after queen elizabeth ii dies \\nshe gets to give away special money to the elderly \\nmaundy money is a special kind of silver coin the queen gives away to pensioners every year at a uk cathedral every easter in a special ceremony the number of recipients corresponds with the sovereigns age this year for example she will be  when easter rolls around so she will give maundy money away to  pensioners \\nthe coins are technically legal tender despite coming in unconventional pence and pence denominations but given the coins rare status they tend not to enter general circulation \\nshes also immune from prosecution \\nall prosecutions are carried out in the name of the sovereign and she is both immune from prosecution and cannot be compelled to give evidence in court \\nin theory the sovereign is incapable of thinking or doing wrong legal scholar john kirkhope told business insider however barrister baroness helena kennedy qc told the bbc in  that nowadays that immunity is questionable \\nalthough civil and criminal proceedings cannot be taken against the sovereign as a person under uk law the queen is careful to ensure that all her activities in her personal capacity are carried out in strict accordance with the law according to official site of the monarchy \\nif the monarch did commit a grievance offence he or she would almost certainly be forced to abdicate there is at least one precedent of the courts prosecuting the sovereign in the th century king charles i was tried for treason following the english civil war he said no earthly power can justly call me who am your king in question as a delinquent the court disagreed and had him executed \\nthe queen has the right to be consulted to encourage and to warn her ministers \\nassuming no grave constitutional crisis the queens input into the legislative process is supposed to be limited in real terms to the right to be consulted to encourage and to warn her ministers  advice delivered via meetings with the prime minister \\nthe queen also has certain historic rights and privileges john kirkhope a lawyer who successfully campaigned to have details of queens consent made public provided business insider with a list of some of the stranger rights the queen still holds \\nhungerford has to present a red rose to the sovereign in exchange for its fishing and grazing rightsthe duke of atholl must pay by way of a rose whenever the sovereign calls this most recently happened during the reign of queen victoria so its unclear whether the rose has to be any particular colourif the sovereign passes near kidwelly castle in wales the tenant has to provide a bodyguard in full armour this is complicated slightly by the fact the castle is a ruinthe marquis of ailesbury owns savernake forest and is required to produce a blast on a hunting horn should the sovereign pass through the forest this last happened in similarly the owner of dunlambert castle in northern ireland has to produce a blast on an ancient bugleand lastly many landowners must also pay a quitrent  a kind of tax on their property paid to the monarch some are pretty unusual

leather \\nyou dont tell the cabbie about aliens \\nthats okay he says as he drives on aliens gee makes sense i guess i never heard of nothing like aliens pass the rest of the ride in silence come to think of it i did see some aliens tonight and they were big \\nah thats too bad says the cabbie like i said i never heard of anything like aliens before but i was getting ready to believe you especially if they had big nice legs ones like you just described though thanks but no thanks pass the rest of the ride in silence come to think of it the aliens i saw did have big nice legs five of them \\nthe cabbie nods excitedly and these hollow black eyes and thats it \\nthe cabbie is rapt with awe with fearsome ivory fangs \\nthe cabbie signals you to keep going and five big nice legs and thats it \\nah the legs i can picture it perfectly says the cabbie aliens i never heard of nothing like that before but i can practically see those legs kicking so nice and so big \\nthe cab begins to swerve as the cabbie becomes more excited about how big the aliens legs were and is no longer paying any attention to the road im telling the truth the legs were big wait i just remembered the legs were small \\nyes those big alien legs the cabbie shrieks as he completely loses control of the vehicle which goes careering up a nearby volcano his last words as the taxi plummets over the verge and into molten lava are i believe you \\nsomeone believed that you were abducted by aliens but at what cost at the cost of dying in a volcano start over \\nhere we are sisters apartment says the cabbie

about the fact that you are outside and have seen aliens text your sister the alien emoji the abduction emoji and the outside apartment emoji \\nyour sister answers the door immediately she invites

any aliens says your sister is that really the whole story yes thats it there was more \\nthen i dont believe you saw any aliens \\nouch you really bungled the story about how you were abducted by aliens you are a miserable bard of the supernatural and your sister didnt believe you at all you have failed start over \\nyour sister settles in as you begin your alien testimony \\nit began like any other night i thought it was guy fawkes night so i was in the forest setting off fireworks by myself i would light the firework run back to safety look up and \\n boom good riddance sir fawkes it was so much fun i decided to light another firework i wasnt having fun but i decided to light another firework \\ni lit the firework stepped back and looked up i expected to see a sparkling skyrocket what i saw was a sparkling skyrocket just as i had expected a strange light in the sky \\nyes it was a skyrocket my expectation was on the money \\ni prepared to launch another firework into the sky i loaded it up sprinted back to safety and looked to the sky again this time expecting to see the gorgeous blue and purple firework known as the butchers delight and the butchers delight it was and thats when it happened \\ni was right again in the clear sky above me i saw the firework called the butchers delight \\ni set up the last firework drew a match and lit the fuse it was a quick fuse so the firework had already launched by the time i turned around and looked up thinking i would see the unmistakeable multicolored burst of the salute to james buchanan firework but is that what i saw looking to the skies yes it was it was not for that was when it happened \\nyes my sibling the salute to james buchanan firework exploded as planned \\ni applauded at the fireworks finale congratulating myself on another successful night of fireworks even as i realized that i had bungled the guy fawkes date again then i went home then i came right to you \\nthank you says your sister that was a very nice story about how you set off fireworks in the woods by yourself and did you see any aliens while you were at it yes no \\nwell i dont believe you you only told me about fireworks i was expecting to hear more about aliens \\nyou have not convinced your sister that you saw aliens wait i didnt tell it right start over \\nokay says your sister its too bad nothing happened with aliens \\nyou have not convinced her that you were abducted by aliens wait i didnt tell it right start over \\na strange light appeared in the sky i ran but the strange light followed me i couldnt escape it there was a sudden burst of futuristic light \\nscience enveloped me the light only got more futuristic then all of a sudden i was standing on the ufo deck \\nwhen the light faded i noticed that i was on a spaceship \\nthis part of the ship was clean and triangular i noticed that the spaceship had some sort of artificial gravity i could tell immediately that the spaceship was in space \\nokay i think i understand that you were on a spaceship says your sister get to the aliens though how about some aliens in the story when you were on the spaceship were there any aliens that you saw yes i dont know but my boss from my first job was there \\nmy boss from my first job was there and he was happy to see me my boss said that i was dreaming and i said yes that seems right my boss said that i was dreaming and i said no thats wrong but it later turned out that he was right \\nhmm says your sister it sounds to me like instead of encountering aliens you had a dream about seeing your boss in space could that be right yeah thats definitely right wait i told the story wrong let me start over \\nyou were trying to get your sister to believe that you had seen aliens but all you managed to convince her of was that you had a dream about seeing your boss in space you failed start over \\nthere were aliens a crowd of them huge mighty creatures with skin like leather hollow black eyes and fearsome ivory fangs the aliens were shouting at me but i couldnt understand what they were saying jench crev amamu the aliens shouted but i could not understand \\nfrom among the aliens a bigger alien stepped forth i immediately realized this was their mayor of the aliens as the alien was wearing a ceremonial mayoral jacket the mayor took out a device \\nthe mayor reached out and put the device over my eyes \\nsuddenly i could hear everything differently the mayor then seemed to speak to me in english \\nwelcome to my ufo said the mayor you are now wearing language glasses they allow you to understand anything that we say in our language but be careful it doesnt work the other way around if you want to learn how to talk like us youll need to visit the language room and earn a diploma from the language guide i told the mayor that i understood i told the mayor that i didnt understand i asked the mayor to explain who the aliens were and what their purpose was \\ni dont know what youre saying but im going to assume you asked who we are and what our purpose is \\nto do that i will need to tell you how the world works in the universe there are three kinds of things first there is us we are called people you can tell were people by inspecting our beautiful ivory fangs and big thick legs its obvious \\nsecond there is god god is special secret and far away and there is only one of him and we need to find him so that we can hold hands forever we dont know where god is but we are looking for him \\nlast there is rocks rocks is everything else planets are rocks spaceships are rocks since you are not a person you are probably also a rockunless of course you are god but thats very unlikely and illegal i asked the mayor how to find out if i am a rock or if i am god \\ni still cant understand you but heres the deal im going to retreat to the observation deck and look at the majesty of space for a while go to the language room learn our language then come find me and well see if we can find a use for you the mayor left and i was alone with the crowd of aliens \\nin the spaceships deck the crowd of aliens was talking excitedly about god and about the kinds of dances they would do together when they found him at last i left the deck area and went south into the hallway \\nin the language room a man was standing on a small circular stage \\nabove him hung a giant banner that read language tutorial for english speakers he began the tutorial \\nwelcome to this free alienlanguage tutorial for english speakers said the man if you are viewing this in hologram form it means our captors have determined i am no longer necessary and that they have mercifully killed me and freed me from my didactic prison right on i waved my hand through him to confirm that he was a hologram i continued watching the presentation \\nhe was not a hologram \\nha not yet i wish he said please sit down and lets get this presentation over with i sat back down and kept watching the presentation \\nlets begin with the most basic grammatical element of the language the word crev the man began \\nhe gestured in the air beside him where the word crev appeared in red light \\ncrev is a verb that roughly translates as to be about to point at something if you want to communicate effectively with the aliens its an extremely important word to know crev i managed to say creb i blurted stupidly \\nfor example to announce that i am ready to point at something i would begin with the word amamu which means me then i would say crev then i would say what i am pointing at \\nlike this amamu crev meryl streep i looked where the man was pointing i knew then that the man was pointing at meryl streep \\nhello said meryl streep i am definitely a hologram amamu crev meryl streep i said as i pointed at the meryl streep hologram \\nvery good the next word were going to learn is important but be aware that it is very politically charged i am of course talking about the controversial word crevv and you must be very careful with it its a slur that means bad alien and is extremely insulting to use in any situation but language tutorials crevv i said i nodded solemnly i asked the teacher for an example of the bad word in context \\nhere is an example of crevv used in english context oh god the aliens are killing me why did i say crevv why didnt someone teach me not to say crevv i shouldnt have said crevv i said okay i said nothing \\ncrevv i said \\nno sooner had the word left my lips than a fearsome ivory fang had pierced my vulnerable stomach and sent everything inside me all over the place i was dead \\nyou wrap your story about the aliens \\nah soyou died your sister asks yeah wait i didnt tell the story right let me start over \\nhmmm idoubt it says your sister \\nyou told a story about how you got abducted by aliens and died but your sister doesnt seem convinced \\nno one believed you you failed wait i didnt tell the story right start over \\nat this point youre almost conversant in the language you just have a couple more words to get through i am now teaching you the word jench it means god i said jench \\nfinally the word bride is the equivalent of the english word um when you say the word bride it means that you have forgotten how to speak and you are trying to remember i said bride \\nthis concludes this first and only module of alien language for english beginners thank you for learning with me get out there start speaking the language and remember if im not already dead please find someone who will kill me \\nwith that

       " 'email yoda is a sick elderly reptile who lives alone at a motel in a swamp hes an absolute mess and hes incapable of looking after himself do you think you have what it takes to be his livein caretaker  before we get started you need to understand that this is not a glamorous job yoda is miserable to be around he needs constant supervision and his hygiene is appalling caring for him is an aroundtheclock gig and it requires an extraordinary level of patience and compassion youre going to have to put up with a lot of bullshit thats okay im confident i can handle whatever challenges the job throws my way wow that sounds pretty difficult i suppose id just have to try my best and hope i do a good job honestly i dont really have any experience with anything like this i already know that i would do a terrible job  one of the most important aspects of the job is tending to yodas skincare needs his skin is dry flaky and covered in sores and it needs to be rubbed down several times a day with a special prescription lotion unfortunately yoda hates being touched and he wont let you put the lotion on without a fight sometimes hell spray you with his stink gland or try to bite you other times hell scurry underneath the couch and try to dig a hole in the floor to hide in frantically scratching at the carpet until his hooves are bloody and raw with this in mind how would you go about getting him to cooperate with you for his skin treatments using simple terms he can understand id explain to him why the skin treatments are necessary and id work with him to figure out what exactly he doesnt enjoy about them and then use that information to tailor the process for him so that its as painless and comfortable as possible i would trap him underneath a laundry basket until he burns off all his combative energy then once hes tuckered out i would pin him to the floor with my knee and apply the lotion to his skin as quickly as possible before he gets a second wind id spread a thin layer of the lotion around the inside of a garbage bag then id roll a tennis ball past yoda to create a distraction and while his attention is diverted i would run over and stuff him inside the garbage bag id shake him up and down inside the bag until his body was covered in lotion and then i would dump him out on a mat of paper towels to clean off any excess lotion i would really rather not touch his gross skin so id probably just leave the lotion out on the counter for him  yoda always makes a huge fuss about eating his fruits and vegetables and if he had his way he would live entirely off of slim jims how would you ensure that hes eating a healthy nutritious diet and not just slim jims i would make him healthy vegetarian slim jims out of ground mushrooms spices lentils and other wholesome ingredientshe wouldnt be able to tell the difference i would dip all of his slim jims in nail polish remover to make them taste horrible leaving him no choice but to eat the vegetables if he doesnt want to go hungry i would tell him that his nemesis count dooku is coming to spay him and the only way for him to get strong enough to fight back is if he fills himself up on powerful vitamins and minerals like the ones found in fruits and vegetables i would mash the fruits and vegetables into a paste and force the paste down his throat with my fingers  yoda spends hours each morning tending to a patch of weeds out back that he refers to as his crops its pretty harmlesshe mostly just sprays the hose and drags a rake around a bitbut if you dont keep an eye on him hell sneak away and try to find the chosen one thats what he calls the trasheating swamp pelican that lives in the pond behind the house its unclear why he thinks this pelican is so special but hes already given it his lightsaber and all of his money in an effort to help it defeat the dark side this is all nonsense of course and its important to make sure yoda doesnt give any more of his valuables to this bird what measures would you take to keep yoda away from the chosen one i would tether him to the house with a length of rope thats long enough for him to freely tend to his crops but too short for him to wander off to places he shouldnt be i would dress yoda in a vest covered in flashing lights and bells which would scare the pelican away should it ever try to approach shock collar i would shoot the pelican with a gun and then make yoda eat its disgusting meat so that he realizes that the bird isnt special  theres nothing in the world that yoda enjoys more than watching pornography however doing so gets him extremely riled up and his doctor has warned that his heart is no longer strong enough to handle excitement like this nonetheless yoda will still try to watch porn any chance he gets and the only way to curb this habit is to reprimand him when he does how would you reprimand yoda for watching porn i would revoke his tv and computer privileges for the rest of the day and have him use his time to do something constructive instead i would put an oven mitt over his head and ducttape it in place so hed be physically incapable of looking at pornor anything else for that matter i would leave the oven mitt over his head for an entire day i would strip off all his clothes and parade him around town so that he could see how it feels to have strangers stare at him when hes naked i would charge people  to take pictures with naked yoda and i would spend all the money on something he hates i would put him in the oven and pretend like i was going to cremate him and i would only take him out if he promised to never look at porn again  one thing to be aware of is that yoda is very afraid of airplanes if he hears a commercial jet flying overhead hell freak out and try to use the force to make it crash granted hes probably not strong enough anymore to actually cause any harm but just be aware that thats a thing he might do got it ill make sure he doesnt try to down any airplanes if yoda wants to make an airplane crash who am i to stop him  yoda has no family or friends but he does have a catfish named obiwan that he keeps in a cigar box next to his bed he talks quietly to the catfish for several hours each night but what he doesnt realize is that the catfish is dead yodas doctor is concerned that hes formed an unhealthy attachment to the catfish and he has strongly suggested taking the catfish away from him before he becomes any more emotionally invested in it how would you go about taking yodas catfish away from him while also minimizing the emotional devastation that will result from losing his treasured companion i would get yoda a fishbowl and his very own pet goldfish once he has a real live fish to take care of i trust hell begin losing interest in obiwan and i will then gradually start weaning the dead fish out of his life while yoda is sleeping i would secretly put a small speaker inside of obiwans belly and wirelessly connect it to a microphone that i could use to make the dead catfish talk then the following day when yoda is having his alone time with obiwan i would have the catfish say yoda if you truly care about me please flush me down the toilet so i can go live with my family in the sewer hopefully he would feel comfortable parting with his companion if he thought it was what the dead catfish wanted i would tell yoda that count dooku is coming to make obiwan into a delicious po boy sandwich and the only way for him to thwart his nemesis is to run outside and toss obiwan into the swamp pond so he can swim away to safety i would throw obiwan in the trash and then lock yoda in a cupboard until he stops crying get results results for do you have what it takes to be yodas livein caretaker you have what it takes to be yodas livein caretaker wow sounds like this is the perfect gig for you looking after yoda is a very demanding job but your thoughtfulness and patience would be the perfect counterbalance to his unpleasant lifestyle and turbulent behavior the force is definitely on your side share your results',\n",

these weapons in  the quantities were vast less than a teaspoon of dry anthrax a little bit about this amount  this is just about the amount of a teaspoon  less than a teaspoon full of dry anthrax in an envelope shut down the united states senate in the fall of  this forced several hundred people to undergo emergency medical treatment and killed two postal workers just from an amount just about this quantity that was inside of an envelope \\niraq declared  liters of anthrax but unscom estimates that saddam hussein could have produced  liters if concentrated into this dry form this amount would be enough to fill tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of teaspoons and saddam hussein has not verifiably accounted for even one teaspoonfull of this deadly material \\nsource colin powells presentation to the un on iraq wmd    \\nalthough it is difficult to remember at this point the anthrax scare of late  was widely seen as a followup to the  attacks and a sign of things to come at the dawn of the socalled war on terror beginning in late september and continuing for several weeks multiple anthraxlaced letters were mailed to various media offices and the offices of two us senators killing five and injuring  \\nit did not take long however for the neocons in the bush administration to start insinuating that the anthrax scare was tied to their two favourite boogeymen saddam hussein and osama bin laden \\nin his book  the  anthrax deception  dr graeme macqueen describes this as the double perpetrator hypothesis an attempt to blame the attacks on both al qaeda and iraq he writes \\nwhat i call the double perpetrator hypothesis held that bin ladens group sent the anthrax spores through the mail but that the group had a state sponsor that had supplied the spores namely iraq \\nthis hypothesis insinuated by key government officials and parroted by the press had the added benefit of explaining how the anthrax spores used in the attack could have been weaponized so efficiently \\nmacqueen well the young woman who opened senator daschles mailafghanistan and iraq    \\nthe story of iraqi collusion with al qaeda sounded credible enough to an american public that had no familiarity with the muslim world and was still reeling in shock from the attacks of  the only problem with that story is that it was a complete lie \\nwhen key government scientists came out to denounce the claim that the anthrax contained traces of bentonite a signature of the iraqi anthrax program the bush administration sought to distance itself from any direct connection between saddam and the attacks \\nas filmmaker robbie martin explains in his documentary american anthrax  however that connection was reinforced to the public by way of a complicit corporate media \\nmartin points to disgraced exnew york times journalist and iraqi wmd pusher judy miller as a particularly egregious example of how the media laid the groundwork for the campaign to tie iraq to the anthrax letters \\nas we now know of course the anthrax attacks were a false flag event \\nby early  it was confirmed that the anthrax had sourced to the us army medical research institute for infectious diseases at fort detrick a key facility within americas own bioweapons program soon suspicion fell on steven hatfill a person of interest identified by the fbi who eventually won a  million lawsuit against the department of justice for falsely accusing him of his participation in the attacks and illegally leaking his identity to the press the blame for the attacks was then pinned on bruce ivins a researcher at fort detrick who conveniently died before the fbi could identify him or try him in court the national academy of sciences and the government accountability office have both cast doubt on the fbis scientific investigation of the attacks however and a whistleblower within the fbis own investigation has revealed that the bureau is sitting on evidence that would exonerate ivins \\nwhoever the perpetrator may have beeneven accepting that ivins was the attackerit is a fact that the attacks were a false flag using crudely forged letters to convince the american public that they were written by al qaeda agents and that false flag was aided by the government officials and corporate media talking heads who were happy to propagate this false story in the lead up to war in iraq \\nthe legacy of that war remains with us today the middle east including iraq itself remains in chaos a direct result of the illegal invasion and occupation of that country an invasion and occupation that was sold to the public on the back of brazen lies and outright fabrications \\nthe blood of a million dead iraqis stains the hands of those who lied the public into that war and those who aided and abetted those liars \\nmeanwhile the anthrax attacks themselves remain a case study in how a false flag event can be used to whip the public into hysteria and be led into supporting illegal wars of aggression',\n",

come in peace and exhorting the earthlings to take me to your lizard the storys protagonist arthur dent has this strange request explained to him by his friend ford prefect an experienced galactic hitchhiker \\nit comes from a very ancient democracy you see \\nyou mean it comes from a world of lizards \\nno said ford who by this time was a little more rational and coherent than he had been having finally had the coffee forced down him nothing so simple nothing anything like so straightforward on its world the people are people the leaders are lizards the people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people \\nodd said arthur i thought you said it was a democracy \\ni did said ford it is \\nso said arthur hoping he wasnt sounding ridiculously obtuse why dont the people get rid of the lizards \\nit honestly doesnt occur to them said ford theyve all got the vote so they all pretty much assume that the government theyve voted in more or less approximates to the government they want \\nyou mean they actually vote for the lizards \\noh yes said ford with a shrug of course \\nbut said arthur going for the big one again why \\nbecause if they didnt vote for a lizard said ford the wrong lizard might get in got any gin \\nwhat \\ni said said ford with an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice have you got any gin \\nill look tell me about the lizards \\nford shrugged again \\nsome people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them he said theyre completely wrong of course completely and utterly wrong but someones got to say it \\nif only this was a joke but here we are on the verge of a contest between the two least respected most distrusted candidates to run for office in modern political history and some people say these lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them \\nif there is any solace at all in this years selection cycle it is that as the corbett report has been pointing out since the very day of its inception there is absolutely nothing at stake here the presidential figureheads are mere puppets false fronts for the shadow government and deep state that commands and controls the military economic and diplomatic machinery of the usled world empire \\ndo you really think the oligarchs put their entire system up on the chopping block every four years hoping against hope that the public doesnt use the dreaded ballot box to vote them out of power dashing decades or centuries of carefully cultivated enslavement with pencils and touchscreens just in case anyone dislikes rhetorical questions let me answer that one for you no no they do not \\nbut dont take my word for it take emma goldman as shes been reputed to have said and if she didnt feel free to tell other people that i said it if voting changed anything theyd make it illegal \\nor take hl mencken who in his usual inimitable fashion quipped  \\nthe stateor to make the matter more concrete the governmentconsists of a gang of men exactly like you and me they have taking one with another no special talent for the business of government they have only a talent for getting and holding office their principal device to that end is to search out groups who pant and pine for something they cant get and to promise to give it to them nine times out of ten that promise is worth nothing the tenth time it is made good by looting a to satisfy b in other words government is a broker in pillage and every election is a sort of advance auction sale of stolen goods \\nor take lysander spooner who wrote  \\nthe principle that the majority have a right to rule the minority practically resolves all government into a mere contest between two bodies of men as to which of them shall be masters and which of them slaves a contest that  however bloody  can in the nature of things never be finally closed so long as man refuses to be a slave \\nor wendy mcelroy who reminds us that \\nvoting is not an act of political freedom it is an act of political conformity those who refuse to vote are not expressing silence they are screaming in the politicians ear you do not represent me this is not a process in which my voice matters i do not believe you \\nyes voting is worse than a dead end its less effective than bashing your head against a wall in a vain attempt to cure your headache its more pathetic than allowing the oligarchs into your kitchen and then begging for a scrap of food from your own table it is evil immoral and contemptible it is the act of a slave who has internalized that slavery so thoroughly that he wants to ensure that everyone around him is enslaved too \\nbut as i pointed out in yesterdays conversation with larken rose if there is any bright spot in all of this it is that your vote doesnt matter anyway and will not change anything at all it will not even register as a protest as some would like to believe since the elections are rigged and the votes arent counted \\nso if you are so inclined knock yourself out cast a ballot but instead of sitting back and feeling good about yourself for having done this senseless meaningless and immoral act can we at least agree to use the next  days to do something actually productive i leave it entirely up to you how to interpret the phrase actually productive but if youd allow me to offer some humble suggestions \\nfind join or create a community organization or freedom cell with a focus on fostering economic connections and social ties with people in your geographical area \\nfind join or create a community currency  community trading program or community exchange to foster agoristic connection between yourself and others in your area \\ncommit to spending a certain amount of time each week spreading awareness about the banking oligarchy  false flag terrorism  gmo crops  or any subject you feel strongly about either offline or online using the work of others or by starting your own blog newsletter or community meet up group \\nlearn about gardening  canning appliance repair d printing  monetary theory  or any subject that you think will be handy in the event of a government collapse or even if the government doesnt collapse \\nread more books spend less time arguing with people online and more time making friends at the local coffee shop learn a new skill and teach it to someone else \\nin short do all of the million things that have nothing whatsoever to do with the phony baloney political charade exemplified by national selection day because if all you ever do is tick a box in a voting booth and sit back to see who wins the rigged sporting event you probably believe the lizards are the best thing that ever happened to you',\n",

prediction came true httpswwwthesuncouknewsthesimpsonscorrectlypredictedadonaldtrumppresidencyyearsagoinepisodesetinthenearfuture \\nso now you know who to refer to for accurate predictions about the future goodbye tarot cards et al in  i recall reading a survey which concluded that america was not likely to be ready for a woman president for the next twenty years twentyone years later it looks like that prediction was true given that women in america to this day are paid  of what men are paid it is not surprising that americans find it tough to visualize a woman in the white house in any place other than the presidents bed \\nso what does trump mean for america for american muslims for muslims worldwide for nonwhites in america and globally i am asking this rhetorical question as i see all kinds of doomsday predictions flying around i apologize for taking a different view i see the trump presidency as an opportunity for those who believe in the opposite of everything that donald trump promoted in his campaign to put their actions where their mouths are and show that they are as willing to stand up for what they believe in as he was \\nwhat does trump mean for america i hope he will be the best thing that happened to america ever i hope that he can truly make america great again i say that because though i am not american should i say thank god i am one who believes that a truly great america can make this world great the world truly needs to change we need someone to lead the way to make the world compassionate caring fighting against injustice corruption and poverty disease and ignorance which nation is better suited to lead that fight america has the resources the intelligence the education and the leadership ability which i hope it chooses to exercise trump won on the antiestablishment platform i support that fully the establishment has shown that what it can do is to fail spectacularly the economy crashed and obama rewarded those who crashed it people were and are homeless when there are empty homes on foreclosed loans enough for every american to have two homes not only one yet they are on the streets i hope trump can put americans back in their own homes \\nbush father and son started never ending wars obama continued them adding his own flavor to it of drone strikes  using technology to create bug splats the arrogance is incredible  thereby escalating the global threat level that comes from driving people to desperation obamas dabbling what else to call it in middle eastern politics resulted in continuing the misery for people of afghanistan and iraq and new misery for people of syria and by inference for the rest of the world and to top it all isis came into being because of all of the above the credit can be shared by all of them so trump standing against the establishment means that he is against all of this i sincerely hope so \\nall the jingoism that he rode on will get tempered when it comes to facing reality it is easy to talk about kicking out the mexicans and so on but the day he does that reality will dawn on him and his cohorts like it did on those who voted probrexit that the rich need the poor to survive while the poor dont need the rich when nice white americans get to pay  per potato they will realize the value of cheap labor meanwhile some contractor will get the contract to build the wall which he will do from the mexican side no doubt as otherwise his margin will not make it worthwhile so also the wonderful idea to outlaw the h visa i dont think it will take very long for trump and his gang to realize that there is a reason there are blond jokes and that indians are not blond go figure that \\nthe good news is that trump made public what was private  racism misogyny in a country that never stops trumpeting about womens equality support for genocide wars and weapons sales the evils of unbridled capitalism lockerroom conversations which indicate attitudes  have all come out of the closet and lockerroom now it is up to those who like to say that they believe in the opposite of all these things to get off their backsides and bring about change they can no longer live the lives of pretense and lies that they had become used to saying it is not happening here trump proved that it is happening and has trumpeted it from the top of trump tower sorry for so much bad punning in one breath but there you go \\nas for muslims and trump believe me trump is far better than what muslims have seen in the past he is far better than what we have today take sisi the oily royals who are personal friends of every weapons dealer the paki leadership and i can think of several more and trump begins to look like a choir boy what will he do that is not already happening frankly i dont know and dont care to speculate because the prime movers behind muslim affairs and how they are are muslims themselves our leadership or more correctly its spectacular failure ordinary citizens pay the price but whats new about that the fact remains that until we sort that out and do something about taking charge of our destiny we must remain satisfied with others writing the script we are compelled to live by play endings depend on the script not on the players \\nindia is a classic example where a socalled minority of  million is kicked around like a football and used at will by every mercenary politician for his own ends but indian muslims seem to be satisfied with that so who is anyone else to complain if you disagree and tell me that they are not satisfied then i must ask you what it is that prevents them from doing what is glaringly obvious get their act together change their leaders and write their own script  million is not a minority it is a nation but only if it chooses to be same story for muslims globally no point in blaming trump or looking up to him to find solutions it is our problem and we must solve it so let us start doing that \\ntwo other points what about wars global warming and such issues well when you have a nation that lives on perpetual warfare and is supported in that by all the other major industrial nations who either manufacture and sell weapons or buy them how can you pin it all on trump if weapons are made and sold there will be wars wars will happen if they continue to make profits for those who run them that people die is incidental those at the top who laugh all the way to the bank dont those that do dont count they are collateral who are necessary to prove the efficacy of the weapons that were used to vaporize them if it wasnt for the bugs who splatted how would you assess the drones or their operators the fact that the bugs were innocent or that they had families and so on well bugs are bugs and thats all that there is to it \\nglobal warming america decided on that when it chose bush instead of al gore for a minute i thought that was because they got confused because his name is al gore like al ghurair but then i realized that it was because he had a terminal problem he had a brain see his famous movie an inconvenient truth and you will see what i mean httpswwwalgorecomlibraryaninconvenienttruthdvd if you do nothing else buy this and see it at least you will know why you died since you chose that especially americans i believe it is only fair that you understand what you did with trump that came out in the open so get used to summer all year long you wont need to go to the french riviera for a tan you can get it at home that is not inconvenient \\nadd to this the effect ofunending wars refugee movement changing cultures security nightmares coming true widening gap between the rich and the poor global poverty and hunger preventable disease which is not prevented because theres no profit in it  when i think about all this and trumps election nero comes to mind renewing our link with tradition let us dance to the tune whats the use of fiddling otherwise \\nfinal question that everyone is asking how safe is it to have someone like trump with his finger on the nuclear button \\nmy answer is the one who actually pressed that button was as different from trump as could be yet he did it let me leave you to figure out the rest \\nmeanwhile it is midnight where i live far away from trump and america and time to go to bed truly it is said that there is solace in sleep so good night

       " 'napm condemns state and expert apathy on deaths of hundreds of adivasi children in malkangiri demands immediate medical relief and justice \\napex court must intervene urgently state must declare medical emergency \\nrd nov  the national alliance of peoples movements is extremely pained and concerned about the rising number of deaths of adivasi children in the tribal district of malkangiri orissa due to outbreak of japanese encephalitis je while the deaths have crossed the unpardonable mark of  the govt as usual continues to undercut the number to less than the half of the actual deaths even taking the official figure of  deaths it an extremely serious case and calls for an urgent comprehensive action in a situation when state apathy and delay have been primary reasons for these avoidable deaths on such a large scale \\nwe are indeed shocked that the team of experts sent by the centre has tried to absolve the government of all responsibility by attributing the deaths to consumption of some local seeds bana chakundi and not to je and governmental delay thereby blaming the adivasis themselves for the deaths when as per the orissa govts statistics itself  cases are confirmed je there out to have been remedial medical response on a warfooting considering the seriousness of je which can be fatal or can lead to lifelong intellectual behavioral or neurological impairments in many cases it is also a serious question as to why the govt did not ensure timely incorporation of je immunization in the public health delivery as per who standards and remained in denial mode the extremely casual response of the medical department state govt and now even the centre through this expert team only demonstrates that even in this time of crisis the concern is more their onus and image than the life of the children \\npublic health expert dr sylvia karpagam in her reasoned counter to the centres report questions that when the socalled toxic seeds are consumed all round the year and by all families in the tribal region since generations it is intriguing as to why this epidemic erupts here only on children and why now one likely reason might be that the presence of je in the already malnourished children could have been aggravated by the consumption of the seeds in some cases but for the central team to take a generalized and extrapolated position on the basis of only  urine samples out of  official admitted death is certainly not a scientific way of medical research or does it appear convincing in the present circumstances many other experts as well have questioned the central teams unilateral conclusions merely on the basis of toxicity in the urine samples especially since je cases and deaths have been reported across the district even in the malkangiri town \\nit is also pertinent to note that the expert team has remained completely silent on the crucial role or failure of the anganwadis and icds monitoring system in the state in providing nutritional and health support to children in the tribal areas this is despite the fact that the apex court has time and again attached highest priority to ensure health and nutrition in all the tribal tracts and hamlets across the country in the form of hot cooked meals this situation is clearly in violation of the orders of the supreme court in the right to food case civil writ petition no  in fact one has to only go through the fact finding reports by right to food campaign in malkangiri districts conducted in  as well as  the abysmal situation of public health infrastructure and food distribution systems are one of the main reasons behind the regular outbreak of je disease the rampant malnutrition under staffed public health institutions abysmal health infrastructure are providing the perfect breeding ground for outbreak and spread of the disease it is indeed ironical that while on the one hand the union ministry of women and child welfare is pushing for packaged foods and gearing up to sign corporate mous in violation of scs norms on the other the anganwadis and icds servises in many areas of malkangiri or elsewhere especially in tribal areas seem to be utter disarray \\nin the light of this serious situation napm calls upon the centre and state to declare this as a medical emergency and ensure anti jeimmunization and other medical relief on a warfooting demands an independent enquiry into this crisis by a multimember team comprising of renowned public health professions independent health activists and doctors \\ncalls upon the national commission for scheduled tribes ncst and the national commission for protection of child rights ncpcr to immediately take cognizance of the situation and their team including commission members and medical experts to investigate the causes recommend immediate measures and speed up action on the ground \\ncalls upon the governor of orissa to make an immediate visit to the affected areas as the constitutional custodian of peace and good government for the tribal areas and ensure relief and justice to the adivasi children and families \\nappeals to the honble supreme court to immediate take up this matter in the ongoing right to food case civil wp  and issue directions to the state and centre and also monitor the proceedings before the orissa high court in the ongoing pil against the je \\nappeals to all progressive activists students the national media and propeople medical experts to reach malkangiri to assist the adivasis in whatever way possible establish the

viagra that this is still the case when we have a couple of seventyyearolds on the ballot  for an election lasting more than four years please call your doctor  \\nin last weeks newspaper there was a report on the tenth or eleventh woman i have lost track to come forward to say that donald trump made suggestive and inappropriate advances to her during a golf tournament that took place about ten years ago \\nthe woman in question is jessica drake who during her press conference announced that at the time of the tournament she was working in the the adult industry thats what people magazine calls porn for wicked pictures the th century fox of gang banging when the randy donald kissed and hugged her in his room \\ntrump was already in his pajamas when she knocked on his door together with two friends normally in the adult business when three porn stars knock on your hotel door its considered foreplay \\nwhen trumps effusive greeting of miss drake did not lead to more snuggling let alone the suggestion to preview some of her work on the hotel television he offered her  to satisfy his suite dreams \\ndrake again demurred saying that the next morning she needed to get back to los angeles for work by that point in her career she had already notched screen credits for extreme doggie and fornocopia i would mention other titles but as they say at the new york post  this is a family newspaper \\nthat rejection prompted donald to offer jessica an early morning ride of shame on his trump airliner back to la which still didnt turn the trick    \\nthen last week in the presence of her lawyer gloria allred the perry mason of many cases against bill cosby miss drake tearfully repeated in primetime her shock and dismay that mr trump had tried to take liberties with her reputation which after all includes the  adult video news award for the best double penetration sex scene in her classic work fallen \\ndrake said she was coming forward now to stand in solidarity with the other women trump has manhandled although there were suggestions that her outing was timed to coincide with the launch of drakes new online store where devoted viewers can purchase such classics as her guide to bdsm for beginners among other titles \\nnormally scenes such as the one i am describing would be consigned to john oliver monty python or saturday night live  but in the new normal of presidential politics even miss drake gets a respectful hearing on the issues \\nfor example the next day the huffington post reported woman says trump sexually assaulted her offered her  for sex \\nthe deadpan new york times wrote ms drake who appeared saturday with the womens rights lawyer gloria allred said mr trump had hugged and kissed her and the other women without permission \\nthe headline in new york magazine read adult actress jessica drake details trump assault blasts him for uncontrollable misogyny \\nlook i have no doubt that trump is a pig who routinely gropes and propositions women but since when does the press in a presidential election have to source its stories in the adult industry    \\nsadly the answer to this question dates to winter  when bill and hillary clinton figured out that unless a presidential candidate has a sexual storyline few of the voters will pay much attention to their positions on nuclear disarmament or welfare reform \\nduring the  super bowl the clintons appeared on a halftime special of  minutes to deny jointly bill that allegation is false  that he had ever had an affair with gennifer flowers who lived in little rock arkansas when bill was governor and often out jogging \\nin this vaudeville performance hillary played the straight man adding you know im not sitting heresome little woman standing by my man like tammy wynette at least she didnt reference the eagles \\nonly in  under oath in a sworn deposition did bill admit to having a year affair with ms flowers but neither her allegations in  nor his lying about it cost him the election that year \\njust the opposite clintons wanderlust might have won him sympathy among the voters no strangers to sexual boredom who found they had more in common with a softshell baptist bill than an uptight protestant george hw bush \\nnor did clintons impeachment in  for lying about his affair with monica lewinsky under oath in the paula jones case hurt his postpresidential career worth  million  or the electoral prospects of his wife in  \\nbut it did turn sexuality into a mainstream presidential campaign issue which is one of the reasons why this years race seems only to be about sex    \\nno doubt the clintons do find some delicious irony in trumps groping charges as payback for what they view as the republican use of sexuality to impeach bill in  and in  for the gop plan to make his many adulterous affairs fair game for their campaign soundbites cut to an online image of the white house and over it a fading picture of bill smoking a cigar with the caption here we go again \\nwithout the pageantloving casino operating donald trump as the republican nominee in  hillary clinton could well have been vulnerable on the sexual front with bills mistresses steady fodder for negatives ads and the many allegations from his scorned lovers that hillary organized the slutshaming \\ninstead of the  election turning on hillarys marriage to hugh hefners doppelgänger the storyline that has played best in the media is donalds secret life as a groper \\nthe press actually has given trump a pass for his adultery which produced all those wonderful children but zeroed in on his groping in part because he confessed to it on an nbc videotape and also becausethink of ratingsgropers belong in the same basket of deplorables as child abusers and others lurking on subways crowed elevators or near schoolyards \\nbest of all for the clintons politically anyway is that the charge of groping is impossible for trump to refute even denying it sounds sleazy \\nand it colors all aspects of the campaign to wit the new york times headline when at gettysburg trump outlined his vision for america donald trump pledges to heal divisions and sue his accusers    \\nfor its mudslinging i am sure the trump campaign has spent many long hours brainstorming how to tar hillary as a lesbian but even that innuendo has fallen flat despite the rumor mongering that shes in a boston marriage with her assistant huma abedin whose husband anthony weiner is otherwise distracted in high school chat rooms \\nseveral of bills former lovers sally miller dolly kyle and flowers have tried to play up bills pillow talk that hillary prefers the nighttime company of women but none of these allegations have gone further than infowars or the supermarket press  hillary hit man tells all  \\nnor have outofwedlock children a staple of the  campaign as was chanted to grover cleveland  ma ma where  s my pa  gotten much play in this years presidential race \\ntrump and his casino gumshoes have put considerable effort into tracking down the rumor that danney williams is bill clintons illegitimate son by a little rock prostitute named bobbie ann williams \\ntrump invited danney a sympathetic man to the third presidential debate as if to press on bill a scarlet letter despite williams looking very much like president bill the story got no more traction than did the news that malik obama the presidents shunned halfbrother is supporting trump he too got a debate invitation to sit in the box presumably marked shame \\nalso in the dustbin of history are the allegations that flowers aborted bills baby in  and the whispering campaign a great political standby when proof is elusive that chelsea is the product of an affair between hillary and her then law firm colleague webb hubbell \\nthe williams and hubbell stories come with some convincing internet similarities at least in the photographs although in both cases politically this rumor milling whiplashed against trump as voters have only equated such tawdry allegations with his birther past something that has stuck as campaign mud    \\ntechnically birtherism doest directly involve sex although it lingers on its fringes as it speaks to barack obamas illegitimacy his foreign allegiances and possibly disputed paternity including the claim that frank marshall davis was actually obamas biological father another subterranean creed of trumpism \\nagain the documentary proof is a series of lookalike photographs as close as the internet gets to dna that davis was an american communist works well in the campaign as it suggests the origins of obamas political genetic code \\nironically for all his efforts at smear trump came out the loser in the debates when hillary nailed him to birtherism which has become a convenient code word for trumps racism misogyny and intolerance of immigrants especially muslims \\nnor in response did trump have any luck in linking the birther movement to clintons  campaign when according to donald consiglierejournalist sidney blumenthal delighted in the suggestion that barack was born in kenya \\ninstead the debate claim only made trump look disingenuous clinton got a pass on what her campaign may or may not have insinuated in  and at this point no one cares but voters do remember trump as the imperial wizard of birtherism    \\nrepublicans can only blame themselves for wanting to divide the electorate in  along lines of sexual preference or deviance although this strategy was based on hillary being the democratic nominee and anyone other than trump standing for the republicans \\nhad the gop nominee been carly fiorina jeb bush or john kasich clinton inc might well have been vulnerable to possible storylines about infidelity illegitimacy and rape cue up the paula jones description of bill during a business meeting exposing himself in a little rock hotel and settling her lawsuit for  \\ninstead the republicans went with the polyamorous trump who in addition to three marriages has bragged on morning radio about his success with young women and who since  has been leering at miss universe contestantsa bit like austin powers  shall we shag now or shall we shag later  \\nwith trumps resumé of creepy perversion you might have thought that the republicans would drop sexual misconduct from the electoral playbook instead they doubled down to make the case that both clintons if elected would turn the white house into a strip club \\nnot only did the clintons shrug off such innuendo but in response they said in effect if they did it would be to cater to the likes of players such as donald j trump leisure suit and open collar optional    \\nfor the momentand i cant see anything changing in the last days of the campaignthe accepted wisdom of most front pages is that donald trump has groped as many women as tiger woods has watched pole dancing in vegas even the gallery of their women looks about the same \\nconversely few voters seem to care that bill might have forced himself on several women or that hillary helped to cover up his brutality thats a narrative of the s which is perhaps the last time austin danger trump read the newspaper  ive been frozen for  years ive got to see if my bits and pieces are still working  \\nfor most voters in  names such as kathleen willey or juanita broaddrick are as lost in time as nan britton who just before the  election bore a love child with then candidate senator warren harding \\nbritton and the child got republican hush money and a sad little house in asbury park new jersey after harding won she was invited to the white house but their affair so to speak was kept in the closet    \\nif you think about elections as political sitcoms

show would make trump bill clinton and tiger look like apprentices at adultery \\ncome  only something that resembles modern family and a desperatehousewives reality show can crack network primetime

       " 'email \\nit was fiftyfour years or so when a classmate at bard college insisted that i read a short story by isaac babel titled the reserve cavalry commander that he described to me as a cossack soldier miraculously bringing a moribund horse to its feet the red cavalry the title of babels collection of short stories written when the jew and former menshevik was imbedded with prorevolution cossacks had been confiscating peasant horses during the civil war and trading in nags ridden to exhaustion on the battlefield for fresh ones \\nfor the backward peasants this was the sort of intrusion that would become the straw that broke the camels back in about a decade being forced into collective farms like recalcitrant horses drove them into open revolt for the time being however they were inclined to tolerate the communists who at least had come to power on the promise of peace bread and land it was the assault on the gentrys land that for the time being assuaged the peasants \\nresponding to an aggrieved muzhik peasant dyakov the eponymous reserve cavalry commander who was a former circus rider described by babel as redfaced with a gray mustache a black cape and wide red tatar trousers with silver stripes promised that he could make this lively little mare spring to her feet again the idea that the horse splayed out on the ground could be described as lively was almost an insult the muzhik cried out lord in heaven and mother of god how is this poor thing supposed to get up its on its last legs \\ndyakovs ability to bring the horse back on its feet was like jesus raising lazarus from the dead but all the more miraculous since it likely occurred most of babels short stories were based on his experience as a war correspondent he wrote \\nyou are insulting this horse my dear fellow dyakov answered with fierce conviction pure blasphemy my dear fellow and he deftly swung his athletes body out of his saddle splendid and deft as if in the circus ring he stretched his magnificent legs his trousers girded by cords around the knees and walked up to the dying animal she peered at him dolefully with a severe penetrating eye licked some invisible command from his crimson palm and immediately the feeble mare felt bracing power flow from this sprightly gray blossoming romeo her muzzle lolling her legs skidding under her feeling the whip tickling her stomach with imperious impatience the mare slowly and deliberatey rose onto her legs and then we all saw dyakovs slender hand with its fluttering sleeve run through her dirty mane and his whining whip swatting her bleeding ranks her whole body shivering the mare stood on four legs without moving her timid doglike lovestruck eyes from dyakov \\nso you seethis is a horse dyakov said to the muzhik  and added softly and you were complaining my dearest of friends \\nthrowing his reins to his orderly the commander of the reserve cavalry jumped the four stairs in a single leap and swirling off his operatic cloak disappeared into the headquarters \\ntoday reading this story once again for the first time in fiftyfour years i am reminded of how important babel was to me at the time like ezra pound james joyce and thomas mann he was a portal into the world of modernist literature that still had an immense attraction for young bohemians in the early s i never thought once about who babel was or anything about the social reality he was trying to depict all that mattered to me was babels prose that could evoke the mysterious power of a cossack resurrecting a dying horse \\nmy early connections to modernism and my later connections to marxism that superseded it and just about all the other intellectual baggage i carried around with me from the early s converged as i watched a press screening of finding babel that opens on october  th at the cinema village in new york directed by david novack who has a background as a sound engineer it is a film that will be of great interest to those whose appreciation of babel is strictly literary as was mine long ago and to those trying to come to terms with the soviet legacy given the prominence of ukraine today as a possible trigger of wwiii according to some babels multiple identity as jew ukrainian communist and critic of soviet deficiencies is worth pondering \\nthe film is structured around the odyssey conducted by andrei malaevbabel who is the grandson of isaac babel and an acting professor in the theater department of the new college of florida to see where his grandfather lived and to speak with people who knew him or who have studied or been inspired by his work isaac babel was executed for treason in  having been charged with belonging to a trotskyist group and spying for france and austria babels wife antonina pirozhkova who died at the age of  in  is interviewed in the film and provides much of the information about babels personality and his travails as a dissident after her husbands arrest in  the soviet cops told her to forget about him and to regulate her life according to the new york times obituary she was formidable in her own right with her engineering degree she helped to design the moscow subway system the obit notes \\nms pirozhkova recalled babels dismay at her haphazard reading habits which he tried to correct by drawing up a list of the hundred books that every educated person needs to read it included a volume titled the instincts and morals of insects she recounted evenings spent with soviet cultural giants like the film director sergei m eisenstein and visits by foreign luminaries like andré gide and andré malraux \\nit was babels mistake apparently to adhere to the values of the original russian revolution rather than to fall in line as a stalin toady \\nas he travels around ukraine malaevbabel encounters intellectuals and ordinary people who revere babel as one of their own especially for odessa tales another collection of short stories that is as highly regarded as red cavalry written in  and  the stories focus on jewish gangsters living in moldavanka an odessa slum hardly the material youd expect to find written by a partisan of the russian revolution but certainly in keeping with the original inspiration of soviet culture that conformed to terences observation  homo sum humani nihil a me alienum puto  or i am human and nothing of that which is human is alien to me \\nalthough i have never read odessa tales i plan to as soon as i find the time since it is about the same sort of characters my grandfather louis proyect probably knew in byelorussia and who like him escaped pogroms by emigrating to the usa unlike my grandfather who made a life out of building hotels in sullivan county in upstate ny abe kid twist reles and other members of murder incorporated only saw the borscht belt as a place where they could dump their victims in swan lake about fifteen minutes from my home town \\nthroughout the film we hear brief excerpts from both collections narrated by liev schreiber that will be a good introduction to babels literary power there are also interviews with some leading babel scholars including stanford professor gregory freidin who spent a day traveling around paris with malaevbabel to see places where babel lived for a few years before returning to russia we learn that although he could have avoided becoming one of stalins countless victims by living in exile he was too attached to russian culture and language to live abroad \\nwhile in paris babel wrote a play titled maria that likely put him on stalins shitlist although being a freethinking intellectual and artist might have condemned from the start with his theater background malaevbabel is ideally suited to discuss the play with fellow thespians including marina vlady an acclaimed russianfrench actress who reads a letter from the titular character \\nin  gregory freidin mounted a production of maria at stanford university the plays program describes major character isaac dymshit a jewish gangster as a symbol of capitalist rationality while the eponymous maria epitomized the pure romance of the revolution she like the young babel served in the red cavalry \\nnever seen on stage we only hear from maria indirectly as her letter is recited by another character in scene five it begins \\nat dawn the bugle from squadron headquarters wakes me by eight i have to be in the political propaganda division im in charge therei edit the articles of the divisional newspaper i run the literacy classes our reinforcements are all ukrainians they remind me of italians the way they talk and act russia has been suppressing and destroying their culture for centuries in our house in petersburg opposite the hermitage and the winter palace we might as well have been living in polynesia for we knew any thing at all about our people \\nit is writing lines like this that got babel killed rather than spying for france or austria \\nbabel was a friend and protégé of maxim gorky who remained a diehard stalinist despite sharing babels inclination for writing about the lower depths of russian society he was deeply troubled by how maria depicted political corruption prosecution of the innocent and black marketeering within soviet society gorky accused babel of having a baudelairean predilection for rotting meat apparently gorky had forgotten that baudelaire was marxs favorite novelist \\ndavid novack the director of finding babel has a connection to odessa but not to its legendary jewish gangsters he has an ancestor named david nowakowsky who wrote liturgical music for a synagogue there \\nin an interview given to the odessa review  novack sums up isaac babels relationship to the soviet experience that resonates with my own on the left as someone with roots in the existential outsider world of the s that saw albert camus as its most eloquent spokesmen i never found myself comfortable with the trotskyist milieu that fostered cultish obedience to the genius leader to this day it has been these youthful affinities with outsider culture that makes it difficult for me to join any amen chorus on the left even though it is the left that remains my homeland i think that novacks description of babels insideroutsider sensibility can help me preserve my sanity in a period of deep contradictions within the left \\nbabel represented the insider outsider thats what he was he got himself all the way inside up to the upper levels of the nkvd up to beria who ended up supervising his torture in the end personally i dont know if he was in the room but he had an office in the st catharines monastery where babel was tortured that monastery was being used as a torture prison the sukhanovo prison which we note in the film we visited it he got himself as close to the flame as possible as an insider but yet he was an outsider because he was from odessa he was jewish he should not even have been permitted to study under gorky which is where he really honed his skills the only reason that he was able to study under gorky is that he smuggled himself illegally to st petersburg when he wasnt allowed to be there because it was outside the settlement area for jews so babel was an outsider he then found himself with red calvary with the cossacks in the red army running through western ukraine as he

mindbogglingly asinine apparently yglesias agrees with this sentiment matt yglesias deleted something like  tweets yesterday clearly a man proud of his history of astute analysis and voxplanations \\nfortunately the internet is forever and all of the stupid things that yglesias has said can still be found and mocked mercilessly \\nhere are  things yglesias has said that are incredibly dumb \\n yglesias was convinced that people would love obamacare that is until he didnt  mattyglesias obamacare marker  which was solid as of  minutes ago  appears to no longer be markering pictwittercomaeyximig  omri ceren cerenomri october   \\nhis  piece is still available though and in it he whines about how supposedly the media for nonideological reasons is just massively biased toward negativity about this kind of thing yglesias also links to another piece of his in which he claimed that when obamacare becomes the status quo people will still be happy with the status quo quo and easy to frighten \\nin other words yglesias felt that the plebs would eventually succumb to his way of thinking that all fell by the wayside when the obama administration admitted that premiums were set to increase by an average of  percent \\n yglesias made a racist comment toward former louisiana gov bobby jindal r in a  tweet that is now deleted yglesias wrote is bobby jindals reputation for intelligence anything other than ethnic stereotyping \\nyglesias doubled down on his nasty comment when he received backlash tweeting oh fun conservative twitter is in bogus outrage mode \\neventually yglesias backed down tweeting for the record now that i know more about jindals life its clear that hes a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff \\nthe irony of yglesias saying this was not lost on twitter good thing you dont say dumb stuff mt mattyglesias its clear that jindals a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff  jon gabriel exjon june   \\n yglesias once ranted against dumb jewish politicians the leftist pundit wrote a thinkprogress piece in  that was seriously titled dumb jewish politicians in which yglesias highlighted a passage from jonathan chait who wrote in the new republic that thensen joe lieberman ict had to be stupid for not supporting the public option \\ni suspect that lieberman is the beneficiary or possibly the victim of a cultural stereotype that jews are smart and good with numbers chait wrote trust me its not true if senator smith from idaho was angering democrats by spewing uninformed platitudes most liberals would deride him as an idiot with lieberman we all suspect its part of a plan i think he just has no idea what hes talking about and doesnt care to learn \\nyglesias agreed \\nive long held a related theory about eric cantor \\nanyways this reminds me that at a meeting this morning i pitched the idea of trying to do health reform in a secret christmas morning session that only jewish senators would attend theres a whole bunch??boxer cardin feingold feinstein franken kohl lautenberg levin lieberman sanders schumer specter and wyden its a very progressive bunch and lieberman could easily be outvoted \\n yglesias advocated for ending time zones seriously in what was a typical example of vox being a waste of space yglesias wrote a  piece titled the case against time zones theyre impractical  outdated yglesias pontificated \\nnorthern idaho is connected via i to spokane and seattle to its west but not to boise to its south so the couer dalene area is on pacific time rather than mountain time india has broken with the general scheme and adopted a halfhour staggered time zone so as to place the entire country on one time \\nyet while these zigzags and minute zones destroy the pristine geometry of railroad time they serve a very practical purpose it is genuinely annoying to schedule meetings calls and other arrangements across time zones the need to constantly specify which time zone youre talking about is a drag commuting across time zones would be more annoying still which is why the suburbs of chicago that are located in indiana use illinois central time rather than indianapolis eastern time \\nbut the ultimate solution to this problem is not a lot of ad hoc deviations its to shift the world to one giant time zone \\nygleasias then called for one time to rule them alla phrase that prompted jrr tolkien to weep in his graveand then wrote this doozy \\nif the whole world used a single gmtbased time schedules would still vary in general most people would sleep when its dark out and work when its light out so at  most of london would be at home or in bed and most of los angeles would be at the office but of course londons bartenders would probably be at work while some shift workers in la would be grabbing a nap the difference from today is that if you were putting together a londonla conference call at  thered be only one possible interpretation of the proposal a flight that leaves new york at  and lands in paris at  is a sixhour flight with no need to keep track of time zones if your appointment is in el paso at  you dont need to remember that its in a different time zone than the rest of texas \\npejman yousefzadeh explained just how stupid yglesiass time zone piece was writing at ricochet  i grant you that there are times when confusion does take place but seriously who cares is befuddlement regarding time zones really such a pressing issue that matthew yglesias has to take to writing an article demanding that we abolish them dont the people at vox have anything better to write about \\napparently they dont \\n yglesias doesnt understand floridas geography very well yglesias wrote a short blurb in the atlantic in  in which he began thinking aloud about the city of miami \\nid been interested to know what if anything is legally or practically preventing the city from just expanding further and further west if anyone happens to know yglesias said \\npeople immediately pointed the obvious answer miami couldnt do so because there was this thing called a swampmost of which is the everglades national parkcausing such development to be difficult to accomplish \\nyes yes commenters i know its a freaking swamp but theres plenty of development on exswampland in florida  hence all the canals and weirdlooking lakes an exasperated yglesias wrote in an update \\nexcept that the land is not exswampland its an actual swamp  maybe yglesias shouldnt write a blurb that involves him thinking aloud \\n yglesias thinks that lying is perfectly fineif youre a politician yglesias found himself getting smacked around on twitter after he advocated for highspeed rail advocates to provide an unrealistically optimistic projection about the number of riders that will use the boondoggle program to obtain funding from the government \\nfor better or for worse thats politics yglesias wrote at thinkprogress  \\non twitter yglesias attempted to justify it by writing fighting dishonesty with dishonesty is sometimes the right thing for advocates to do yes \\nand yet yglesias had the temerity to accuse journalist eli lake of being dishonest on twitter \\nyglesias must have realized how badly he put himself in a catch when he told the daily caller to go f yourself when they tried to interview him about the twitter incident \\n yglesias once hailed the department of veteran affairs as a healthcare model the country should emulate the federalist s sean davis pointed to yglesias writing in  that the va was producing the highest quality care in the country their turnaround points the way toward solving americas healthcare crisis yglesias also tweeted at gop chairman reince priebus in  will reince be explaining the evils of socialized medicine to veterans this tweet was also deleted and for good reason since the va has caused  veteran deaths due to systemic problems with the agency \\n yglesias doesnt understand the purpose of the senate yglesias wrote the following for thinkprogress in  per the guardian  \\nif you add together the two republican senators from wyoming with the one from alaska one from south dakota one from new hampshire two from maine two from idaho two from nebraska one from nevada two from utah two from kansas two from mississippi one from iowa two from oklahoma two from kentucky one from louisiana two from south carolina and two from alabama the  of them collectively represent on a system in which you attribute half the population of a given state to a senator  percent of the american population meanwhile barbara boxer and dianne feinstein together represent  percent of the american population \\nnow of course texas is also a big state though at  percent of the population its a lot smaller than california and there are small states like vermont and north dakota that have two democratic senators so the point here isnt a narrowly partisan one though the wacky apportionment of the senate does have a partisan valence the point is that this is an unfair and bizarre way to run things if you consider that the mean state would contain two percent of the population we have just  senators representing the aboveaverage states even though they collectively contain  percent of the population the other  senators represent about  percent of the people if the iranians were to succeed in overthrowing their theocracy and set about to write a new constitution nobody in their right mind would recommend this system to them \\nin three paragraphs of rambling incoherent nonsense yglesias missed the fact that the purpose of having two senators representing each state was so states with smaller populations would be properly represented and not have their interests swallowed up by states with larger populations \\n yglesias doesnt understand americas financial system yglesias showed his ignorance of the issue when he wrote in a  slate column that there were far far far too many banks in the country as there were  at the time yglesias bloviated that all these small banks were somehow dangerous \\n they are poorly managed you know how the best and brightest of wall street royally screw up sometimes this doesnt get better when you drill down to the lessbright and notasgood guys it gets worse and since small banks finance themselves almost entirely with loans from fdicensured depositors nobody is watching the store in effect the wellmanaged banks are being taxed to subsidize the poorly managed ones the dubious decisionmaking doesnt get as complicated as what you see on wall streetits mostly just classic boomandbust procyclical commercial real estate loansbut it creates all the same problems  they cant be regulated since these banks are so small they could be easily driven out of business by high regulatory compliance costs so since american public policy is perversely committed to preserving them small banks regularly get various kinds of carveouts from regulations and once the carveouts exist they create pressure for extension further up the food chain other times the compliance issues of small firms become a reason to simply not do tight regulation  they cant compete if you want the jpmorgan chases and bank of americas of the world to be held to account you need both regulation and competition but a bank serving a handful of rural counties or a single midsized city doesnt offer any real competition having a large share of americas banking sector tied up in tiny firms only makes it easier for a handful of big boys to monopolize bigtime finance \\ndavis debunked yglesiass argument which was devoid of citations and falsely claimed that there havent been any new banks formed in recent years there were at least four in  \\nyglesias arguments are so poorly reasoned and so poorly supported that it leads one to question whether his post was thoughtlessly regurgitated from anticommunity bank talking points promoted by the big banks you guys the wall street banks that nearly destroyed america arent the problem small community banks where bankers actually know the borrowers are the real problem dont worry about the facts just go with it davis wrote in the federalist  im actually at a loss to come up with a more charitable explanation \\n yglesias thinks that black conservatives are a recent phenomenon after reading a review of a booker t washington biography yglesias started thinking about black conservative political tradition prompting him to write in a  thinkprogress post its only extremely recently that the idea of an africanamerican aligning himself à la clarence thomas with the mainstream conservative movement in america could be remotely possible but even so that didnt mean there was no ideological conflict in black politics or that general rightist sentiments somehow didnt exist \\nthis is patently false as damon root explained in reason  \\nactually the great harlem renaissance author and journalist george schuylerwho was known as the black hl menckenpublished general rightist sentiments long before clarence thomas came on the scene including schuylers unambiguously titled  autobiography black and conservative and the celebrated novelist and folklorist zora neale hurston both endorsed conservative sen robert a taft in the  presidential election and repeatedly attacked fdrs new deal \\n yglesias expressed joy when andrew breitbart died following breitbarts death yglesias tweeted  conventions around dead people are ridiculous the world outlook is slightly improved with andrewbrietbart sic dead \\nthis tweet has also been deleted and for good reasoncelebrating the death of someone just because of political differences is worse than stupid its ghoulish vile and reprehensible and slate defended yglesias stating that he is a very passionate journalist and slate values that passion \\napparently slate believes that passion trumps basic human decency and a reasonable iq level and yglesias certainly does not possess the latter two qualities',\n",

but nothing is grander nothing is more glorious nothing is more satisfying nothing is sweeter nothing is more validating nothing is better for america than the death of the mainstream medias political power \\nthe elite national political media is done as a force moral or otherwise in this country done buried exposed over out and using a slowacting poison called hubris it was death by suicide so smug so sure of themselves so sanctimonious so snarkfilled so utterly incapable of anything close to selfreflection \\nthe selfinduced poison took effect over a number of years and through five steps \\nhere they are \\n pimping for obamacare \\nthe national political media didnt just cheerlead for obamacare they lied to us willfully and with malicious intent they all lied to us the outlawing of almost every existing insurance plan was right there in the bill right there in black and white but the media didnt care they wanted to give their precious obama a win and in order to do that they jumped on board the you can keep your insurance propaganda express worse those of us who did tell the truth were branded as liars and racists not only by the pundits but by those godforsaken factcheckers \\nthen utopia met reality \\nthen the lies were exposed \\nand the result is that up to and including last night at both the local and national level obamacare has decimated the democrat party but nowhere near as bad as it has decimated the middle class \\nthe medias role in this is unforgivable and destroyed whatever remained of their moral authority from here on they could only get more sweaty desperate and dangerous \\n casting off every journalistic ethic to destroy trump \\nopenly proudly and belligerently in order to hijack a presidential election we were treated to the pompous announcement that trump was such a threat to humanity it was now time for journalists throughout the land to cast off every standard that makes journalism journalism starting with objectivity

deserved a few of the kitchen sinks hurled his way never in my  years have i seen such a coordinated desperate dishonest and poisonous campaign to disqualify a human being through the dark art of stripping him and his supporters of all their humanity \\n embracing confirmation bias \\nthe longer the general election rolled on the smaller the bubble of selfdelusion became \\ninconvenient polls were sneered at and voxsplained away \\nexit polls could only means one thing even though it was pretty clear they might mean another \\nmy personal favorite was the late editorials where based on no counted votes whatsoever we were trolled with the news that it was hillary not trump who would emerge victorious with the hidden vote oh the delicious irony of that oh how lovely it would be to rub that in the rubes faces on election night \\nby the time the votes were actually being counted i was about  sure hillary would win the new york times however was  sure abcnbccbsapbsnprcnnwashingtonpostpolitico were  sure \\nbut even i understood that state and local polls were more erratic than ever that hillary did seem legitimately freaked about the upper midwest that the best pollster in the country had trump up  that trump never lost his fervent base that the right trackwrong track numbers had been upside down for a decade that there was still a

propelled trump to the presidency how was he able to pull off such a stunning upset \\nhere are seven reasons why trump won \\n hillary clinton was unable to get the minority vote to turn out for her last night dems were calling the race a whitelash  wrong mitt won  of white vote trump won  minority voters didnt turn out  david french davidafrench november   \\nin fact trump was able to get a larger share of the minority vote than mitt romney did in  as the daily wire has explained  \\nunsurprisingly trump lost to clinton in the latino and black votes by margins of  percent to  percent and  percent and  percent respectively surprisingly this was better than romney fared among the aforementioned demographics in  as he lost both groups by margins of  percent to  percent and  percent to  percent respectively \\nmichael barone has noted that turnout fell in heavily black philadelphia cleveland detroit and milwaukee millennial generation turnout was tepid and trump carried white millennials by  points \\nthe enthusiasm was just not there for clinton \\n trump was able to pull in former obama voters according to the washington post  trump was able to win over onethird of the  counties that went for obama twice clinton was only able to win six of the  counties that didnt go for obama trump was better at obtaining crossover voters than clinton was \\nso who are these former obama voters who voted for trump in  and what caused them to switch \\n these former obama voters felt that trump cared about them and the democrat party did not john daniel davidson explains in the federalist that clinton and the democrat party took the bluecollar working class whites in the rust belt for grantedexemplified by clintons pledge to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of businessand it was to their detriment the rust belt has been in economic decline for years but it has suffered greatly from the obama administrations regulations towards coal \\nwhile the democrats wrote off the rust belt trump actually acknowledged their struggles and that was all it took \\ntrump was the first national political figure in generations who saw them acknowledged that they have been left behind that their cities and towns are in a state of persistent decline and promised to help out somehow writes davidson when youre used to being dismissed as bitter folks who cling to guns and religion as president obama did in  or denounced as deplorables and irredeemable as hillary clinton did during this election respect goes a long wayeven if there are no easy solutions from washington or anywhere else to the problems that plague your town \\n the fbi reopening its investigation into hillarys emails helped trump per redstate  author ed klein said on the steve malzberg show that clinton was sobbing inconsolably on election night and was blaming fbi director james comey reopening the investigation as well as obama for not stopping the investigation as to why she lost \\ntheres no question that the reopening of the investigation did considerably help trump as the polls severely tightened after the announcement poll numbers showed that the vast majority of americans felt that hillary was acting in an immoral manner the spotlight was off of trumps vulgar comments towards women and his sexual assault accusers and instead the focus was on clintons private email server but clinton is leaving out one major person who is responsible for her loss \\n hillary was a terrible candidate if clinton had been elected president she would have been the first elected president to have been the subject of numerous fbi investigations she broke the law by using her private email server to conduct official state department business and there was a lot of quid pro quo that occurred at the clinton foundation  clinton is robotic and devoid of charisma with a record in politics that is short of accomplishments but rich in failure sleaze and corruption basically clinton is an obama democrat without obamas charm according to jonah goldberg  \\nshe may have been the only democratic candidate that could lose to trump and the democrats wanted to coronate her from the beginning they have no one to blame but themselves for president trump \\n the public no longer has any faith in the mediaand that includes latenight comics will rahn wrote at cbs news that the unbearable smugness of the clintonbiased media was offputting to a lot of voters as they sneered at trump supporters as stupid backward hicks while doing everything they could to prop up clinton trumps vitriol toward the press ended up benefiting him politically poll numbers reflect this as trust in the media has declined over the years rahn explains \\njournalists increasingly dont even believe in the possibility of reasoned disagreement and as such ascribe cynical motives to those who think about things a different way we see this in the ongoing veneration of facts the ones peddled by explainer websites and data journalists who believe themselves to be curiously postideological \\nthat the explainers and data journalists so frequently get things hilariously wrong never invites the soulsearching youd think it would instead it all just somehow leads us to more smugness more meanness more certainty from the reporters and pundits faced with defeat we retreat further into our bubble assumptions left unchecked no its the voters who are wrong \\nas a direct result we get it wrong with greater frequency out on the road we forget to ask the right questions we cant even imagine the right question we go into assignments too certain that what we find will serve to justify our biases the publics estimation of the press declines even further  fewer than oneinthree americans trust the press per gallup  which starts the cycle anew \\nthe same applies to latenight comics mollie hemingway writes in the federalist that jon stewart is partly responsible for the election of trump because of how he singlehandedly destroyed cnns crossfire resulting in a new age of hyperpolitical hyperliberal latenight comedy stewarts the daily show spawned stephen colbert john oliver trevor noah and several other lefty comics that perverted comedy into smarmy leftwing political lectures talking down to conservatives \\njon stewart is known for brutally deriding a show that featured people of differing views civilly discussing issues of the day writes hemingway he got that show killed and significantly strengthened the world where cultural elites engaged in groupthink mockery of those with whom they disagree the results include a further erosion of civility a decrease in americans ability to understand each other and their concerns and of all things presidentelect donald trump \\nwhich all culminates into the main reason why trump was elected \\n americans are tired of being trashed by leftist elites ben shapiro explains  \\ntrump won because many americans were sick of being told that they were the racists as barack obama and his department of justice stoked race riots in major cities around the country \\ntrump won because many americans were sick of watching other americans being destroyed for their supposed intolerance  for their religious beliefs for their unwillingness to label women men and men women for their support for traditional marriage or conservative political candidates \\ntrump won because many americans were tired of the medias constant harping on americas flaws  we were supposedly sexist racist and homophobic americans said that they did not believe the media and they were right to do so \\nin other words the left has been tearing down america as a country infested with intolerant prejudicial bigots who are incapable of thinking for themselves and needed to rely on them on how to live their lives the people finally had had enough so they elected the man whom they felt best stuck it to the leftist elites tags',\n",

       " ' thoughts on steve bannon as white house chief strategist by ben shapiro november   \\nso in a notunexpected move donald trump has elevated former breitbart news ceo steve bannon to chief strategist of the white house \\nwhen i left breitbart back in march i accused bannon of turning breitbart news into trump pravda  as i wrote indeed breitbart news under the chairmanship of steve bannon has put a stake through the heart of andrews legacy in my opinion steve bannon is a bully and has sold out andrews mission in order to back another bully donald trump he has shaped the company into trumps personal pravda to the extent that he abandoned and undercut his own reporter \\nthat decision paid off for bannon  in august he became trumps campaign ceo at that point i wrote this piece describing who bannon was  and this one for the washington post describing his probable impact on the campaign  \\nwith bannons accession to a top white house role its time to answer some brief questions about the man and what hes likely to do \\nis bannon antisemitic and racist i have no evidence that bannons a racist or that hes an antisemite the huffington posts blaring headline white nationalist in the white house is overstated at the very least with that said as i wrote at the washington post in august bannon has openly embraced the racist and antisemitic altright  he called his breitbart  the platform of the altright  milo yiannopoulos the star writer at the site is an altright popularizer  even as he continuously declares with a wink that hes not a member the lefts opposition to trump and their attempts to declare all trump support the altright have obfuscated what the movement is the movement isnt all trump supporters its not conservatives unsatisfied with paul ryan nor is it people angry at the media bannon knows that hes a smart man not an ignorant one the altright in a nutshell believes that western culture is inseparable from european ethnicity  i have no evidence bannon believes that personally but hes happy to pander to those people and make common cause with them in order to transform conservatism into european farright nationalist populism that means that the altright will cheer bannon along as he marbles trumps speeches with talk of globalism  and that bannon wont be pushing trump to dump the racists and antisemites who support trump anytime soon after all they love bannon  actual white supremacists like peter brimelow called his august appointment great news and richard spencer explained breitbart has elective affinities with the alt right and the alt right has clearly influenced breitbart in this way breitbart has acted as a gateway to alt right ideas and writers i dont think it has done this deliberately again its a matter of elective affinities that doesnt mean bannon will push racist or antisemitic policy or that hell be antiisrael himself  unless it serves his interests \\nwhat does bannons accession mean bannon has goals one of those goals is maximization of personal power which is why he spent the last decade and a half glomming onto powerful rightwing personalities bachmann morris palin kissing their asses and then moving on up the chain with breitbart and trump he picked two winners in a row  and that means hes now at the pinnacle of american power \\nso what will he do with that power hell target enemies bannon is one of the most vicious people in politics which is why ive been joking for months that should trump win id be expecting my irs audit any moment that wasnt completely a joke he likes to destroy people \\nbut more importantly bannons interested in turning the republican party into a farright european party because republicans will like some of the policy that comes with that it could happen heres what i wrote in march about the trump movement  \\ntrump is a europeanstyle response to the europeanstyle leftism of barack obama hes a soft europeanstyle populist from his interventionist economics to his closedborders foreign policy as i wrote in december compare trumps platform with that of marine le pen whose french national front poses a significant threat to the national political establishment she calls for harsher penalties for criminals significant restrictions on muslim immigration to france protectionism on trade a restoration of the franc as the national currency rather than the euro and big government in terms of health care this sounds a lot like trump but the european right is not the american right the american right believes in constitutional ideas about checks and balances and federalism and negative rights from government the european right doesnt believe any of these things should trump win we could watch american conservatism lose the only party it has ever had \\nthats the plan yesterday the daily beast reported that bannon reached out to le pen for global ultraright coalition over the weekend le pen met with nigel farage of the uk independent party and trump met with farage shortly after being elected bannon has always wanted to burn down the gop thats still his goal he wants it replaced with an american national front party in fact if not in name \\nwhich war will bannon lead bannon considers himself a wartime consigliore  always at war always so the only question left is this what will bannons actual role be its difficult to tell since trump announced the bannon hire at the same time he announced that former rnc chairman reince priebus as his chief of staff what will their relationship be like ed morrissey of hotair thinks that bannon will lead the antimedia fight and reince will coordinate with congress that would be the best possible scenario \\nothers have speculated that bannon has been added to the team as a sop to the populist base which would be angry at trump hopping into bed with the most establishmenty fellow in washington that too would be fine \\nits hard to tell from the outside whats happening but heres a third theory reince is the bagman for trump and bannons whispering in trumps ear that would fit the fact pattern here given reinces outsized praise for bannon this morning wise and smartvery very smart very temperate bannon is anything but temperate to those who disagree hes a consummate bully to anyone who disagrees hes actually malevolent priebus may not

night and amid raucous leftist protesters who consistently tried to interrupt him and even blocked him from being seen by the audience by creating a human wall in front of him found a way to respond with hilarious repartee that left the audience howling and the protesters eventually filing meekly out of the auditorium \\nafter the ovation he received on entering shapiro quipped hey look at this a campus that doesnt actually try to arrest me when i come he continued before i begin i did come bearing gifts for the social justice warriors in this room i hear youve started wearing these safety pins around because you want to show your fellow college students how youre not one of these awful terrible trump people that youre sensitive and that you want to signal your virtue so ive brought along these safety pins holding up safety pins and i also brought you something to wear them with  this diaper \\nshapiro then held up a diaper prompting huge laughs from the audience \\nwhen a protester yelled at shapiro that he should be wearing a swastika shapiro held out his yarmulke then fired back in case you hadnt noticed the folks with the swastikas arent too nice to my type \\nshapiro continued stop being selfindulgent children stop pretending that everybody who voted for trump is a vicious racist its your right to protest of course but you just make yourself look like an idiot when you cry over a dulyheld election  donald trump doesnt care about your protest donald trump is sitting somewhere in trump tower eating a steak and bathing in your salty salty tears \\nreferring to the attempt by leftists to prevent people who werent university students from attending shapiros lecture shapiro opined i hear that a lot of folks at this publiclyfunded university want this campus to become a sanctuary campus for illegal immigrants i do have a quick question if this campus can be a sanctuary for people in the country illegally why are so many people trying to ban american citizens from this community from coming to this lecture and by the way im aware of this private facebook page titled f white supremacy interrupting ben shapiro with all due respect f you right back gang \\nafter the applause subsided and shapiro joked about how both black lives mater and the kkk target him the real fun began protesters stood up chanting shame over and over again \\nshapiro quipped wow its like game of thrones  should i get undressed and walk down the aisle \\nthe bulk of the crowd started booing the protesters shapiro addressed the protesters saying im happy to talk with you but they responded by screaming safety over and over shapiro joked did somebody fart the crowd responded to the protesters by chanting usa \\nshapiro replied i tell you try not to be children the first thing you do is start screaming like my twoyearold he added you see this is how conservatives actually treat people you stand up and you interrupt and you shout safety and youre perfectly safe look at that its amazing that provoked sustained applause \\nwhen the protesters started screaming shame again shapiro eviscerated them pointing out if youre going to pick a chant like shame watch game of thrones first the bad guys shout shame the audience loved that line on a roll shapiro continued youre not changing anybodys mind all youre showing everybody is that your collective iq if it were channeled into electricity night be able to toast a piece of bread lightly \\nhe continued okay can we talk now or are you going to keep shouting nows your chance to get it out lets hear your feelings cmon just go for it or is it going to be like every thirty seconds like an annoying microwave timer \\nwhen the protesters resumed chanting shapiro responded if you guys want to talk we can talk if you want to shout get the hell out more applause \\nshapiro fired for gods sake at least wait until i say something that offends you before getting offended \\nshapiro returned to deconstructing the term social justice when the protesters started again a woman who runs a soup kitchen stood up and admonished the protesters that she had driven for ten hours that day and that they should shut freaking up and listen to the man speak that prompted a standing ovation from the crowd and shapiro too he added see thats what a decent hardworking person sounds like as opposed to a loser student here on the public dime presumably \\nshapiro returned to his speech racial diversity doesnt mean anything decency means everything  diversity isnt our strength decency is our strength he turned to the protesters remember that decency \\nthe protesters screamed back shame shapiro fired back decency the protesters chanted shame but the crowd soon joined shapiro in chanting decency shutting the protesters up \\nas shapiro spoke of the falsity of white privilege the protesters formed a line in front of shapiro prompting him to quip if you guys are all going to come up here can we all just have circle time or something \\nthe protesters chanted safety for a minute and a half but then the crowd started yelling back free speech matters shapiro turned to the blackboard behind him and wrote in capital letters morons that again prompted cheering \\none member of the audience yelled to the protesters at least tell us what you want or otherwise just get out that brought a sustained ovation \\nafter one protester tried to deliver a whiny monologue the protesters started shouting safety again then filed out yelling f white supremacy while flipping off shapiro and the entire audience that prompted the crowd to sing nananana nananana hey hey goodbye it also promoted this from shapiro \\neven after leaving the lecture hall protestors continued to pound on the door \\nafter shapiro explained why the protesters had not been arrested as the university stated that it gave the protesters time to protest at the front of the stage or otherwise it would have to shut down the entire event he continued all i can wonder is if the administration would allow the same sort of privilege for any sort of conservative who decided to do this at a leftist event \\neven after leaving the lecture hall protestors continued to pound on the door prompting shapiro to quip doesnt this school give homework does anybody have a job around here i guess when youre majoring in gender and diversity studies you have a lot of time on your hands \\nshapiro noted that he had engaged in a backandforth with one of the protesters who accused him of being a white supremacist when he asked her why she thought so she replied that she got that impression from his image he fired back really was it the yarmulke that did it for you \\nhe took another shot at the protesters during the speech noting that people were born unequal and adding some people us are born rich some of us are born poor some of us are born smart some of us are born protesters \\nthe rest of the speech was vintage

       " ' things you need to know about sanctuary cities by aaron bandler november   \\nwith donald trump elected to the presidency one of the policies that will likely come under fire is sanctuary cities cities with policies that make them safe havens for illegal aliens the issue became frontandcenter during the early portion of the republican primary when trump decried the murder of kate steinle by an illegal alien in san francisco a sanctuary city \\nin response to the election of trump leftist city leaders are digging in officials in los angeles chicago and boston signaling that they will not cooperate with the federal governments deportation efforts here are five things you need to know about sanctuary cities \\n sanctuary cities are a blatant violation of federal law some on the left have tried to claim that theyre perfectly legal but this is clearly false as james walsh  former associate general counsel of immigration and naturalization services explains  usc section  deals with those persons who knowingly conceal harbor or shield undocumented aliens and could apply to officials in sanctuary cities and states \\nthe fact that leftists are digging their heels in on sanctuary cities means theyre supporting a form of nullification an irony not missed by victor davis hanson  \\nmuch of the rural west opposes the endangered species act can wyoming declare that federally protected rats and bugs are not protected inside its state borders when such pests obstruct construction of dams or highways many conservatives oppose federal restrictions on gun sales could oklahoma city declare handgun purchases within its citylimits free of federal firearms statutes perhaps little rock could ignore a supreme court ruling and announce that gay marriage is not legal within its jurisdiction on what rationale would liberals in california object to such nullifications  that neither state nor city had the right to ignore a federal law or to obstruct the law enforcement duties of federal officials \\ntrump and the gop can fight against sanctuary cities by cutting off federal funding and sending in federal agents to mandate the cities to follow the law \\n sanctuary cities undermine law enforcement not only do they refuse to cooperate with federal agents in deporting illegals sanctuary cities make it more difficult for police officers to do their job some police officers in the los angeles police department lapd expressed their frustration with the citys sanctuary city policy to heather mac donald in  \\nwe cant even talk about it says a frustrated lapd captain people are afraid of a backlash from hispanics another lapd commander in a predominantly hispanic ganginfested district sighs i would get a firestorm of criticism if i talked about enforcing the immigration law against illegals \\nin that  piece mac donald documents how members of the lapd were able to recognize known gang members but couldnt do anything to apprehend them until they had committed a crime  despite the fact that they were illegals who repeatedly snuck back into the country this is the case with other sanctuary cities as well \\n sanctuary cities are akin to roulette the odds suggest that most illegal aliens detained by officials are not career felons and thus supposedly need not be turned over to ice for deportation writes hanson on the chance that some of their  released criminals will go on to commit further crimes in the manner of juan lopezsanchez officials then shrug that the public outcry will be episodic and quickly die down or will at least not pose political problems as great as would come from deporting aliens \\nbut the odds dont suggest this hanson notes that according to mac donald twothirds of all outstanding felony warrants in the city of los angeles involved illegal aliens  as well as  of outstanding murder warrants \\nadditionally jessica vaughn of the center for immigration studies found that in a ninemonth timeframe in  sanctuary cities shielded  illegals from deportation  percent of which had significant prior criminal histories and  of them were subsequently rearrested for new crimes according to daniel horowitz at conservative review \\nthere is no telling how many have committed crimes and were never caught writes horowitz this is just a ninemonth snapshot of the devastation from sanctuary policies as of last year  of them were still at large so much for not being a flight risk \\naccording to vaughn  from january  to september   sanctuary cities rebuked over  detainers  percent of which involved individuals with a prior criminal history \\nbased on these statistics it would seem that the odds are against the cities residents who could be harmed by criminal aliens which makes it no surprise that \\n crime has surged in sanctuary cities the daily wire s hank berrien reported on the following from louisiana attorney general jeff landry \\naccording to louisiana attorney general jeff landry crime has risen in sanctuary cities across the nation \\nlandry told the house judiciary committees subcommittee on immigration and border security that sanctuary city policies allow illegals to commit crimes then roam free in our communities landrys appearance was prompted by the changed status of new orleans where city police are now banned from asking an individuals immigration status \\nusing recent statistics from los angeles another sanctuary city landry asserted los angeles saw all crime rise in  violent crime up  percent homicides up  percent shooting victims up  percent rapes up  percent robberies up  percent and aggravated assault up  percent  sanctuary cities encourage further illegal immigration and promote an underground economy that sabotages the tax base \\nthis would make sense given the aforementioned statistics and the fact that there is a clear link between illegal immigration and crime  \\n there are an estimated  sanctuary cities counties and states according to vaughn the full map on such jurisdictions can be seen here  do you live in a sanctuary city',\n",

sen jeff sessions ral who has long been a favorite of conservatives the democrats already have the long knives out for sessions spitballing their usual accusations of racismwhich should indicate that sessions will be an effective attorney general \\nhere are seven things you need to know about sessions \\n sessions has a  percent liberty score on conservative review  sessions has been in the senate for  years and has been described by the washington times as a tea partier before the tea party was cool per conservative review s biography  \\n sessions has been one of the leaders in the senate in fighting against amnesty for instance sessions was among the most prominent members of the senate leading the opposition to the gang of eight bill national review  which dubbed sessions amnestys worst enemy explained how sessions would reveal true facts about the bill in an attempt to persuade some senators that hadnt decided how to vote on the legislation sessions and sen david vitter rla would find other clever ways to oppose the bill such as an amendment to a resolution honoring the late latino union organizer cesar chavez in which vitter noted chavezs opposition to illegal immigration putting sen bob menendez dnj in an awkward position \\nin  sessions introduced a bill that would overhaul the immigration system according to conservative review  overturned the zadvydas v davis supreme court case that obama is using as an excuse to release criminal aliens after six months of detention explicitly deputized the states to enforce federal immigration law eliminated sanctuary cities by cutting off dhs and doj law enforcement grants expedited deportation of gang members applied the ramifications of treating illegal aliens as criminal aliens to those convicted of drunk driving clamped down on loopholes that allow legal immigrants who commit crimes to continue on the path to citizenship instead of getting deported this would address cases like the legal immigrant who murdered the family in the washington dc mansion murders \\nsessions has also fought efforts to increase legal immigration as he has railed against it as the primary source of lowwage immigration into the united states \\nwhat we need now is immigration moderation slowing the pace of new arrivals so that wages can rise welfare rolls can shrink and the forces of assimilation can knit us all more closely together sessions wrote in a  oped in the washington post  \\n sessions has also spearheaded efforts to crack down on budgetary issues according to conservative review s biography of sessions \\nin january  he was named ranking member of the senate budget committee in this capacity he led the republican charge against majority leader harry reid and barack obama for not offering a serious budget proposal given that the senate had not passed a budget since april  he has fought guerilla warfare often a lonely battle against democrats spending by raising budget point of orders against the breach of budget caps he has even fought his own party when his office put out devastating research against the ryanmurray budget deal sessions has also been a strong leader on welfare reform and publishing studies and data on the extent of the welfare state \\nsessions has voted against the tarp bailout stimulus bills and increases to the debt limit and has traveled through his state with charts warning of the united states crippling debt per the washington post  \\n sessions endorsed trump early on to the surprise of many in the establishment sessions endorsed trump in february declaring  i believe we are on a movement that must not fade away this is a campaign this is a movement the american people are not happy with their government \\nit shouldnt have come as a surprise though given sessions record on immigration and that sessions tends to be more protectionist on trade \\n sessions is wellliked by his senate colleagues on a personal level according to the washington post  \\nsay what you will about him former longtime senate democratic communications aide jim manley told the almanac of american politics he was always nice to the late ted kennedy and other democrats as well \\neven people who have run against him have nice things to say about him stanleybecker talked to susan parker a democrat who tried to unseat sessions in  during a debate she asked for a tissue and sessions handed her one she joked she would use it to dry her eyes when sessions made her cry and he responded please dont say that thats my nightmare i promise ill be nice \\nits no wonder then that sessions will likely be confirmed by the senate \\n accusations of racism against sessions are absurd when president ronald reagan nominated sessions who at the time was a us attorney to a federal judge the democrats smeared sessions with accusations of racism which included calling a black attorney boy quipping about the ku klux klan i used to think they were ok but they are pot smokers joking that a white attorney was a traitor to his race because he was collaborating with civil rights groups calling the naacp and aclu unamerican prosecuting a civil rights organization for voter fraud \\nthe last point isnt racist at all the jokes as ben shapiro has written  were made in front of the black lawyer even the lawyer accusing sessions of racism acknowledged that sessions was joking clearly sessions meant them as harmless jokes sessions has also denied calling the lawyer boy the civil rights group sessions prosecuted has faced accusations of voter fraud for many years \\nsessions record on race actually shows that he has consistently fought against racism as the weekly standard s mark hemingway writes \\nas a us attorney he filed several cases to desegregate schools in alabama and he also prosecuted the head of the state klan henry francis hays for abducting and killing michael donald a black teenager selected at random sessions insisted on the death penalty for hays when he was later elected the state attorney general sessions followed through and made sure the hays executed the successful prosecution of hays also led to a  million civil judgment against the klan effectively breaking the back of the kkk in alabama \\n as attorney general sessions would uphold the rule of law the reason why sessions has been such an immigration hawk is that he supports the rule of law he has also fought against judicial activist nominees and is a strong supporter of the death penalty between that and his legal background as a us attorney and alabama attorney general there is every reason to believe that sessions will follow the law and not politicize the justice department \\nhis interpretation of the law will not please everyone but i predict it will be fairly applied without fear or favor robert driscoll  former deputy assistant attorney general wrote in national review  clear cases will be prosecuted with vigor creative interpretations of the law may cease but the meatandpotatoes work of the division intentional discrimination police misconduct disability law will continue apace conducted without impropriety

persecute gays they chortle at evil sexist colbert who thinks men are victims of sexism this is the purpose of colberts routine his show is about pure hatred for conservatives in the same way that blackface was about pure hatred of blacks in order to justify their racism racists had to create a false perception of blacks in the same way colbert and his audience can justify their racism only by creating a false perception of conservatives \\non saturday night colbert waxed eloquent over his fear of a trump presidency arguing im all for giving him a chance but dont give him an inch because i believed everything he said and i remember everything he said and its horrifying its possible the job changes a man thats the cliche of the presidency he pontificated \\nevery president tries to achieve what they promised and you can say well there are levers of power in washington that can slow him down but two things one is theyre cowards second is that the levers in washington are

       " 'by m jaggers ld we discussed yesterday the various reasons why trump won the election mr jaggers thinks trump won because he promoted the interests of the vast underclass of disenfranchised whites who were sick to death of the neoconservative liberal elites as typified by the loathsome hillary clinton it is in trumps own interests jaggers believes not to betray the whites who voted for him by reneging on his promises there must be no uturns no cuddling up to the zionist enemy no wishywashy compromises or backslidings trump is now expected to make america great again  or else a tall order well see ld \\n in certain times there is a surreal feeling of being a part of history which is perhaps to say we are living in a time period of dynamic change however unthinkable for the left it may be trump has been elected we can add this to brexit and other unthinkable events to come to contemplate the details of what this may entail such as the selection of cabinet members and policy priorities  which do indeed include building that wall has something of a christmas morning feelingeveryday \\nto paraphrase an from die welt  in western democracies the status quo seems stable and it is not generally considered possible for extremes to transpire but that is what we have seen however we may want to quibble about what exactly is extreme can donald trump or the altright for that matter be considered extreme after that electoral show of consent regardless when there is an endless back and forth between stultifying uncourageous republicans and the frankly antiwhite agenda of the democrats extreme does not carry such a negative connotation but instead implies a kind of deliverance \\nwe have been locked in a middleclass complaisance and that is precisely why societies such as ours are often surprised by the foreseeable and obvious and alas though it may be unspeakable to liberals and though he was the object of such ridicule in our media trump is now the most powerful man in the world as die welt puts it perhaps with some apprehension just let that sink in explanatory factors \\ntrumps appeal may have been equally a reaction to black lives matter protests as to immigration according to exit polls  percent of trump voters feel that blacks are treated fairly by the criminal justice system which by definition means that these voters are not sympathetic to black lives matter overall half of white voters democrats and republicans opined that blacks are treated fairly by police likely most of us will have anecdotal evidence that our nonaltright family members and acquaintances were not amused by black lives matter trump voters were especially unamused \\nof trump supporters  percent favor building the wall on the southern border compared to less than half of all voters  percent oppose  percent favor so antipathy towards both black lives matter and immigration can be said to have catapulted trump to the presidency  in part by turning off mainstream middleclass white people who are normally content with the statusquo moderates may not want a wall per se  but they also may not complain too loudly when its being built and again trumps actual voters want it builtunequivocally \\nwhile losing some steam amongst collegeeducated whites trump won the white working class by  points  an increase from romneys  point spread ultimately there is no simple narrative that emerges trump increased white support in different key swing states from different rural and suburban demographics in order to dominate the electoral college i wont pretend to be nate silver so lets just say he won because of white people \\namong his supporters opines thomas friedman on real time with bill maher  this was  percent about race and the other  percent was about race \\ngood then lets accept the premise of liberals and draw the necessary conclusions if trump triumphed on the basis of race issues he now has a mandate on immigration law and order the wall etc \\nfor the nytimes david brooks holding forth on public broadcasting service pbs trump voters are just going with their gene pool  a rather bald statement that trump voters are voting their ethnic interests after the election brooks predicted that the country would be split into two factions with one faction advocating ethnic separatism what many on the alt right are already advocating would that it were so \\nnixon became known to history as the law and order candidate which accurately characterized his proclivities visàvis crime trump on the other hand to leave no doubt selfidentified as the law and order candidate as liberals will complain and as the altright will readily admit law and order is understood to mean that we will not tolerate black violence and civil unrest trumps support therefore was premised on his intolerance for the very violence which his election has provoked once again from blacks and other malcontent minorities in the protests following his victory which continue as i write this \\nit is ironic that blacks report feeling scared at the prospect of the trump presidency while they are in fact the progenitors of violence and so far as i know trump never made any negative statements explicitly about blacks their violence and disorder has indeed scared the rest of civil society contributing to trumps election perhaps blacks are expressing their fear by attacking innocent whites in this inverted reality how can we assuage these sensitive blacks sense of fear shall we become human punching bags you cant always get what you want \\nif there is one thing that minorities have learned over the last eight years it is that they get what they want and whites perhaps as a natural corollary do not hence the indignation following this surprise victory \\nsome journalists noted with amusement that trump often played the rolling stones you cant always get what you want at his campaign rallies i hypothesized that trump liked the song for its beautiful choral section which has a celestial quality that built anticipation for his arrival on stage surely he paid little heed to the message of the lyrics which discordantly seemed to suggest he was voters second choice but now it all makes sense i suggest that for our underprivileged people of color its time you learned you cant always get what you want \\nnot only is the people of color poc attitude of entitlement and aggrievement ridiculous it is also presumptuous \\nwhile the msm claims that the onus is now on trump to reach out to those who didnt vote for him ie blacks and hispanics it would seem that he was given a mandate to serve the interests of those who did vote for him  it follows logically that he would now carry that project through and enact the policies which mobilized his base and put him in the oval office sourced from the occidental observer like this share it now  thoughts on  trump won because of white people  györgy says november   at  am \\nyou cant always get what you want \\nif there is one thing that minorities have learned over the last eight years it is that they get what they want and whites perhaps as a natural corollary do not hence the indignation following this surprise victory \\nproblem has been favouring certain ethnic groups beyond reasonability people are people for example employment should go to the best qualified candidate regardless of race or ethnic creed an assumption is made on the governments part that an employer will unfairly select anglo saxon over other races which is wrong therefore the employer must use race based quota agendas to effect equality \\nthis is a form of dictating morality by an amoral government this is one area that mr trump ought to behove',\n",
       " 'part   the six stages of the exorcism process by lobro van helsing part  of this article is authored entirely by lobro van helsing and consists largely of graphic details about the exorcism process as described by malachi martin in his controversial book hostage to the devil  part  of the article entitled the deceiver of the world is by lasha darkmoon and continues where part  leaves off this reflects on various apocalyptic issues such as armageddon and the last days the problem of good and evil and the role of the jews in human history \\nthe devils finest trick is to persuade you that he does not exist  charles baudelaire \\nwhy is it so hard to accept at least hypothetically that in the words of observant thinkers like baudelaire the devils finest trick is to convince us that he does not exist \\nit is generally accepted that the devil preys on human souls and what do predators do in all the settings natural political online they all use disguise and it shouldnt be beyond comprehension that the devil if he existed would use whichever cloak of invisibility was the most effective for the occasion therefore not seeing the devil or sensing his presence proves absolutely nothing \\nfor those who are interested the material here comes from a book hostage to the devil  by father malachi martin a trained exorcist in the roman catholic tradition \\nfr malachis material featuring several cases of authentic demonic possession and their accompanying exorcisms in modern day america was carefully vetted through use of tape recorders and reinforced later on by lengthy interviews with the participants in the exorcism process    \\nin  in south africa  clara germana cele age  reportedly made a pact with the devil as a result her behavior suddenly took a bizarre turn for the worse in august of that year the startled nuns at the convent school where clara was a student witnessed her tearing at her clothes growling like an animal and engaging in conversation with unseen entities \\nnuns reported that the girls skin would burn when sprinkled with holy water she would lash out violently when crosses or other sacred objects entered her presenceshe also reportedly developed clairvoyant powers and was able to describe personal details of other peoples lives that she couldnt possibly have known ab out \\nthe accounts of several nuns also reported that clara possessed the ability to speak and understand several different foreign languages to which she had never been exposed including polish german french and several others it was said that clara had been imbued with superhuman strength as well easily overpowering authority figures at the school when they attempted to restrain her \\nanother seemingly farfetched assertion from many witnesses was that clara began levitating up to five feet in the air on a regular basis her clothes sticking to her body as if they too had managed to defy the laws of gravity it was claimed that only after being sprinkled with holy water could she be brought back down during which time she would also temporarily snap out of her possessed state \\nmost outlandish of all were the claims that the young woman had the ability to transform into a sort of snakelike creature her body becoming as flexible as rubber as she slithered across the floor at one point she was said to have bitten a nun on the arm and left puncture marks like those of a serpents fangs \\nsee here  \\nnote this case history is not to be found in malachi martins hostage to the devil i have added it to the article as an afterthought since it contains within it many of the typical features found in demonic possession before you read any further please watch this minute video in spanish with english subtitles warning this article contains material that is deeply disturbing those of sensitive disposition are advised to refrain from further reading \\napart from the quoted extracts randomly chosen among many to illustrate various aspect of possession or exorcism i wish to make the following points although the book deals only with cases in the catholic community demonic possession is a universal phenomenon and has been noted and researched in countries all over the world the possessor often referring to itself as the kingdom or in plural as we selects victims gripped in some spiritual emotional and intellectual conflict with the accepted mores of family society and church inserting itself undetected into these fault lines and exploiting them with catastrophic consequences loss of self identity soul or personality follows as a result there is invariably an element of guilt on the part of the victim who has initially invited possession by his or her aberrant behavior and life style in extreme cases the possessed individual has actually made a formal request for possession in order to gain some advantage eg worldly wealth or fame the process of expelling the possessing malignancy moves through identifiable stages \\none of the most experienced exorcists i have known malachi martin notes who was in fact the mentor of the exorcist in the first case related in this book gave names to the various general stages of an exorcism these names reflect the general meaning or effect or intent of what is happening but not the specific means used by the evil spirit or by the exorcist conor as i call him spoke of six stages presence pretense breakpoint voice clash and expulsion  exorcism exacts practically intolerable toll on the priest in charge not infrequently resulting in his death at which point the junior helper must take over the task demonic possession is not an isolated or freak phenomenon it seems to be on the rise especially in the united states perhaps this has something to do with the demise of religious authority the proliferation of satanist covens child abuse and sacrifice the prevalence and glorification of satanist elements in pop culture and finally the wide acceptance and promotion of sexual perversion as a new norm \\nthe incidence of exorcism fr martin begins by pointing out has been on a steady rise there has been a  percent increase in the number of exorcisms performed between the early s and the mids over the same period there has been an alarming increase in the number of requested possessions  that is cases in which the possessed formally request satan to possess them  in comparison to the cases of incurred possessions which result from other sorts of activities of the possessed that facilitate possession \\neach year some  to  major exorcisms and some thousands of minor exorcisms are performed for experts in the field this is a sobering barometer of the increase in known cases of possession but it is still more sobering to realize how many more cases of possession cannot be addressed at all the thousands of letters i receive from people who are desperate for help  catholic protestant evangelical and unchurched  are eloquent anguished and a steadily mounting testimony to the crisis \\nlaw officers meanwhile are increasingly confronted on every side by the incontrovertible signs of crimes committed in the course of ritualistic satanism or as a grisly result of an individuals participation in such rituals they are very often left out of the shrunken loop of expert advice and assistance advice and assistance that was once routinely to be found \\nto those who are active in the field of exorcism and who therefore acquire a greater than usual ability to uncover and recognize the marks of ritualistic satanism for what they are it is clear that in many police precincts the satanist character of a crime is either relegated to the background or not mentioned at all  at least not in public reports \\nby and large the police have no other choice they have neither competence nor authority in the rarefied and dangerous field of satanist behavior most of the above points were made on numerous occasions in mythology and folklore eg vampires werewolves and the tale of dr faustus adapted by marlowe and goethe jesus christ was of course the grand exorcist not only in the gadarene swine incident but his opus seems to me to have been focused on confronting the devil in judaism for which he paid with his life  the tale does not end there in my view but i leave these speculative elements to the reader    the six stages of demonic possession \\nfrom the moment the exorcist enters the room a peculiar feeling seems to hang in the very air from that moment in any genuine exorcism and onward through its duration everyone in the room is aware of some alien presence  this indubitable sign of possession is as unexplainable and unmistakable as it is inescapable all the signs of possession however blatant or grotesque however subtle or debatable seem both to pale before and to be marshaled in the face of this presence \\nthere is no sure physical trace of the presence but everyone feels it you have to experience it to know it you cannot locate it spatially beside or above or within the possessed or over in the corner or under the bed or hovering in midair \\nin one sense the presence is nowhere and this magnifies the terror because there is a presence an other present not a he or a she or an it sometimes you think that what is present is singular sometimes plural when it speaks as the exorcism goes on it will sometimes refer to itself as i and sometimes as we \\nthis is reminiscent of the possessing entity in the gospel who when asked his name by jesus replied i am legion i am legion \\ninvisible and intangible the presence claws at the humanness of those gathered in the room you can exercise logic and expel any mental image of it you can say to yourself i am only imagining this careful dont panic and there may be a momentary relief but then after a time lag of bare seconds the presence returns as an inaudible hiss in the brain as a wordless threat to the self you are its name and essence seem to be compounded of threat to be only and intensely baleful concentratedly intent on hate for hates sake and on destruction for destructions sake    \\nin the early stages of an exorcism  the evil spirit will make every attempt to hide behind the possessed so to speakto appear to be one and the same person and personality with its victim this is the pretense  \\nthe first task of the priest is to break that pretense to force the spirit to reveal itself openly as separate from the possessedand to name itself for all possessing spirits are called by a name that generally though not always has to do with the way that spirit works on its victim \\nas the exorcist sets about his task the evil spirit may remain silent altogether or it may speak with the voice of the possessed and use past experiences and recollections of the possessed this is often done skillfully using details no one but the possessed could know it can be very disarming even pitiful it can make everyone including the priest feel that it is the priest who is the villain subjecting an innocent person to terrible rigors even the mannerisms and characteristics of the possessed are used by the spirit as its own camouflage \\nsometimes the exorcist cannot shatter the pretense for days but until he does he cannot bring matters to a head if he fails to shatter it at all he has lost perhaps another exorcist replacing him will succeed but he himself has been beaten every exorcist learns during pretense that he is dealing with some force or power that is at times intensely cunning sometimes supremely intelligent and at other times capable of crass stupidity which makes one wonder further about the problem of singular or plural and it is both highly dangerous and terribly vulnerable \\noddly while this spirit or power or force knows some of the most secret and intimate details of the lives of everyone in the room at the same time it also displays gaps in knowledge of things that may be happening at any given moment of the present \\nbut the priest must not be lulled by small victories or take chances on hopedfor stupidities he must be ready to have his own sins and blunders and weaknesses put into his mind or shouted in ugliness for all to hear he must not make excuses for his past or wither as even his loveliest memories are fingered by ultimate filth and contempt he must not be sidetracked in any way from his primary intention of freeing the possessed person before him and he must at all costs avoid trading abuse or getting into any logical arguments with the possessed the temptation to do so is more frequent than one might think and must be regarded as a potentially fatal trap that can shatter not only the exorcism but quite literally shatter the exorcist as well \\naccordingly as the pretense begins to break down the behavior of the possessed usually increases in violence and repulsiveness it is as though an invisible manhole opens and out of it pours the unmentionably inhuman and the humanly unacceptable there is a stream of filth and unrestrained abuse accompanied often by physical violence writhing gnashing of teeth jumping around sometimes physical attacks on the exorcist    \\na new hallmark of the proceedings enters as the breakpoint nears and ushers in one of the more subtle sufferings the exorcist must undergo confusion complete and dreadful confusion rare is the exorcist who does not falter here for at least a moment enmeshed in the peculiar pain of apparent contradiction of all sense \\nhis ears seem to smell foul words his eyes seem to hear offensive sounds and obscene screams his nose seems to taste a highdecibel cacophony each sense seems to be recording what another sense should be recording each nerve and sinew of onlookers and participants becomes rigid as they strive for control panicthe fear of being dissolved into insanityruns in quick jabs through everyone there all present experience this increasingly violent and confusing assault but the exorcist is the one who rides the storm he is the direct target of it all \\nthe breakpoint is reached at that moment when the pretense has finally collapsed altogether the voice of the possessed is no longer used by the spirit though the new strange voice may or may not issue from the mouth of the victim in thomas wus case the alien voice did come from the possesseds mouth and that was why the police captain was so startled the sound produced is often not even remotely like any human sound \\nat the breakpoint for the first time the spirit speaks of the possessed in the third person as a separate being for the first time the possessing spirit acts personally and speaks of i or we usually interchangeably and of my and our or mine and ours \\nanother very frequent sign that the breakpoint has been reached is the appearance of what father conor called the voice  \\nthe voice is an inordinately disturbing and humanly distressing babel the first few syllables seem to be those of some word pronounced slowly and thicklysomewhat like a tape recording played at a subnormal speed you are just straining to pick up the word and a layer of cold fear has already gripped youyou know this sound is alien but your concentration is shattered and frustrated by an immediate gamut of echoes of tiny prickly voices echoing each syllable screaming it whispering it laughing it sneering it groaning it following it they all hit your ear while the alien voice is going on unhurriedly to the next syllable which you then try to catch while guessing at the first one you lost by then the tiny jabbing voices have caught up with that second syllable and the voice has proceeded to the third syllable and so on \\nif the exorcism is to proceed the voice must be silenced it takes an enormous effort of will on the part of the exorcist in direct confrontation with the alien will of evil to silence the voice the priest must get himself under control and challenge the spirit first to silence and then to identify itself intelligibly \\nas in all things to do with exorcism of evil spirit the priest makes this challenge with his own will but always in the name and by the authority of jesus and his church to do so in his own name or by some fancied authority of his own would be to invite personal disaster merely human power unadorned and without aid cannot cope with the preternatural it is to be remembered that when we speak of the preternatural we are not speaking about what are known as poltergeists \\nusually at this point and as the voice dies out a tremendous pressure of an obscure kind affects the exorcist this is the first and outermost edge of a direct and personal collision with the will of the kingdom the clash  \\nwe all know from our personal experience that there can be no struggle of single personal wills without that felt and intuitive contact between two persons there is a twoway communication that is as real as a conversation using words the clash is the heart of a special and dreadful communication the nucleus of this singular battle of wills between exorcist and evil spirit    \\npainful as it will be for him the priest must look for the clash he must provoke it if he cannot lock wills with the evil thing and force that thing to lock its will in opposition to his own then again the exorcist is defeated \\nthe issue between the two the exorcist and the possessing spirit is simple will the totally antihuman invade and take over will it noisome and merciless seep over that narrow rim where the exorcist would hold his ground alone and engulf him or will it unwillingly protestingly under a duress greater than its singletrack will stop identify itself cede retire disappear and be volatilized back into an unknown pit of being where no man wants to go ever \\neven with all the pressure on him and in fullest human agony if the exorcist has got this far he must press home he has gained an advantage he has already forced the evil spirit to come out on its own if he has not been able to until now he must finally force it to give its name and then some exorcists feel the exorcist must pursue for as much information as he can for in some peculiar way as exorcists find the more an evil spirit can be forced to reveal in the clash and its aftermath the surer and easier will be the expulsion when that moment comes to force as complete an identification as possible is perhaps a mark of domination of one will over another \\nit is of crucial interest to speculate about the violence provoked by exorcismthe physical and mental struggles that are so extreme they can bring on death why would spirit battle so why not leave and waft off invisibly to someone or someplace else for spirit itself seems to suffer in these battles \\ntime and again in exorcism after exorcism there occurs that curious thing to do with spirit and place the strange puzzle mentioned previously in connection with the room chosen for the exorcism when jesus expelled the unclean spirits those spirits showed concern for where they might go in record after record as well as in several exorcisms recounted in this book the possessing spirits wail in lament and questioning pain where shall we gowe too have to possess our habitationeven the anointed one gave us a place with the swinehere    we cant stay here any longer \\nevil spirit having found a home with a consenting host does not appear to give up its place easily it claws and fights and deceives and even risks killing its host before it will be expelled how violent the struggle probably depends on many things the intelligence of the spirit being dealt with and the degree of possession achieved over the victim are perhaps two one could speculate about \\nwhatever determines the actual pitch of violence once the exorcist has forced the invading spirit to identify itself and sustained the first wordless bout of the clash and then invoked its formal condemnation and expulsion by the exorcism rite the immediate result is generally a struggle tortuous beyondimagining an open violence that leaves all subtlety behind \\nthe person possessed is by now obviously aware in one way or another of what possessed him frequently he becomes a true battleground for much of the remainder of the exorcism enduring unbelievable punishment and strain \\nit is sometimes possible for the exorcist to appeal directly to the possessed person urging him to use some part of his own will still free of the spirits influence and control and engage directly in the fight aiding the exorcist and at such moments no animal pinned helplessly to the ground struggles more pathetically against the drinking of its lifes blood by a voracious and superior cruelty the very nauseous character of the possessed persons appearance and behavior appears to be a sign of his desire for deliverance a desperate sign of struggle evidence of a revolt where once he had consented \\nincreasingly what had possessed him is being forced into the open all the while protesting its victims revolt and its own expulsion the violence of the contortions and the physical disfigurement of the possessed can reach a degree one would think he could not possibly withstand \\nthe exorcist too comes in for full attack now once cornered the evil spirit seems able to call on a superior intelligence and will try to lure the exorcist on to a field boobytrapped and mined with situations from which no human can extricate himself \\nany weakness in the religious faith that alone sustains the exorcist or any fatigue will allow the exorcists mind to be flooded with a terrible light he cannot fend offa light that can burn the very roots of his reason and turn him emotionally into the most servile of slaves desperate to be liberated from all bodily life \\nthese are only some of the dangers and traps that face every exorcist his pain is physical emotional mental he has to deal with what is eerie but not enthralling with something askew but intelligently so with a quality that is upside down and inside out but significantly so the mordant traits of nightmare are there in full regalia but this is no dream and permits him no thankful remission \\nhe is attacked by a stench so powerful that many exorcists start vomiting uncontrollably he is made to bear physical pain and he feels anguish over his very soul he is made to know he is touching the completely unclean the totally unhuman  the totally unhuman  click to expand  \\nall sense may suddenly seem nonsense hopelessness is confirmed as the only hope death and cruelty and contempt are normal anything comely or beautiful is an illusion nothing it seems was ever right in the world of man here is an atmosphere as bizarre as bedlam \\nif in spite of his emotions and his imagination and his bodyall trapped at once in pain and anguishif in spite of all this the will of the exorcist holds in the clash what he does is to approach his final function in this situation as an authorized human witness for jesus \\nby no power of his on account of no privilege of his own he calls finally on the evil spirit to desist to be dispossessed to depart  and to leave the person possessed \\nand if the exorcism is successful this is what happens the possession ends \\nall present become aware of a change around them the sense of presence is totally suddenly absent \\nsometimes there are receding voices or other noises sometimes only dead silence \\nthe recently possessed will wake up as if from a dream a nightmare a coma sometimes he will remember much of what he has been through sometimes he will remember nothing at all    many people could be demonically possessed without knowing it here are two individuals who in my opinion might benefit from the ministrations of a good exorcist is this woman demonically possessed who knows    but many have said so click here for a spooky minute video is this woman demonically possessed who knows    but many have thought so apart from the demonic expression that disfigures her face this woman preaches white genocidethe total destruction of the european race what more do you have to do to qualify for demonic possession see here for more details on barbara spectres psychopathy and compare the expression on her face with figure  of this illustration from a medical textbook on demonic possession   as i wrote in a recent email to lasha darkmoon i feel that the entire tribe of judah is demonically possessed they always have been for centuries jesus made that point over and over again in his homilies and clearly the jews works bear that out they are now the devils agents on earth to promote his policies and spread contagion into the body of the goyim history bears me out on this \\ni will not quote dr darkmoons response here it is too long and would require a separate article of its own suffice to say that she disagreed with me on several counts though she accepted my general premise that demonic possession was an authentic and veridical phenomenon and not just a superstitious relic of the dark ages continued in part  the deceiver of the world  by lasha darkmoon \\nlobro van helsing is a retired canadian academic who is constantly on the move and likes

the far right because donald is a zionist i agree with donald that we should stop funding isis and let vladimir putin take them down it was obama who armed isis and let a small band become an international menace overnight by allowing them to take mosul in  and refusing to let the usaf take them out on that highway from syria but i do disagree with donalds intention to confront iran for what resisting zionism \\nbut fortunately for iran what trump and americas rulers want will soon become irrelevant of course that is not good news for americans who blindly follow the people who think they own the government of the united states \\ni have just now seen from europe sheer postelection idiocy some are claiming that donald trump is the puppet of the fourth reich and is backed by the

run by a criminal elite i had written that catherine austin fitts said the us military and intelligence services had given donald a green light to dish out dirt on hillary these men were on the inside of the vile mechanism that runs america but even they thought hillary was one witch too far to go \\ni have reported on the elite end game many times before their plan is far worse than just cloning

made people like you ie taxpayers liable for the inevitable consequences for their actions just add another few hundred trillion dollars onto the pile of unpayable debts to be taken out of your pension fund your savings your bank account and your paycheck their malfeasance will become your obligation in the very near future at least that is what they are planning \\nthe bankers gave you a system in which you cannot have money unless you go into debt the federal reserve will not issue paper money until the treasury gives them a bond obligating us to pay them interest on money they created out of nothing you cannot have checking account money until someone takes out a loan and is willing to pay the bankers interest on money they created out of nothing \\nif we had lincolns noninterest bearing greenbacks we would not have  trillion in national debt and be paying  billion a year in taxes to pay the resulting interest \\nthe recent sharp rise in the interest rate on  year treasury bonds means our financial system is near collapse \\na depression is a period in time when unpayable debts are cancelled en masse since we foolishly have a debt based system that means money vanishes every time a debt is discharged in foreclosure or in bankruptcy court it is this sudden sharp contraction in the money supply that creates all the unemployment \\ni have quoted dr steve keen many times before we are headed to the worst financial crisis in the past five centuries because we have more unpayable debts to cancel than at any time in the past  years \\nso what is worse than the fourth reich tens of millions of americans starving to death or killing their neighbors because they have nothing to eat \\nin short a race war to end all wars \\nof course this is what americas elite had planned for them they stole all of the pension funds and the savings they created the trade deals that closed  manufacturing plants and sent millions of jobs overseas they added  million people to the countrys population through legal and illegal immigration they papered over unemployment by using funny money to hire  million federal state and local workers making it appear like everyone was engaged in productive work they used funny money to give out unearned benefits to tens of million of people to minimize starvation until the day of reckoning \\nthe day of reckoning has arrived \\nthe  year treasury bonds interest rate at  is at record highs for recent years that means the crash and the nationwide food riots and the race wars will soon be upon us it was only zero interest rates that kept the ponzi scheme going this long \\nthe only exit path i see is for the us military to be asked to stop the food riots as soon as they begin to ravage the country \\nand the junior officers

would be appointed \\nmichèle angelique flournoy a former under secretary of defense for policy is hillarys choice for the position of secretary of defense who favors the no fly zone option \\naccording to defense one the woman expected to run the pentagon under hillary clinton said she would direct us troops to push president bashar alassads forces out of southern syria and would send more american boots to fight the islamic state in the region \\nconfirmed by the leaked emails michele flournoy is a crony of the clintons she has called for limited military coercion to help remove assad from power in syria including a no bombing zone over parts of syria held by usbacked rebels this is tantamount to a no fly zone to protect the terrorists including isis daesh from actions by syrian and russian forces \\naccording to defense one flournoy and several of her colleagues at the center for new american security or cnas have been making the case for sending more american troops into combat against isis and the assad regime than the obama administration has been willing to commit\\nsince russias increased involvement the facts on the ground in syria she said do not support the kind of negotiated conditions we would like to get to us policy should be the removal of assad even if that meant using limited military coercion flournoy said at mondays annual cnas conference in washington \\nflournoy did not deny the entire report that she favors increased us intervention for instance she acknowledged her support for us strikes using standoff weapons  to retaliate against syrian military targets to enforce the nobomb zone \\nthe press reports however did not quote the details of the discussion and testimony of general dunford and secretary of defense carter at the arms services committee hearing let me see if the chairman wants to add anything\\nsenator wicker well let me just ask this if you dont mind secretary carter it would help if the barrel bombing ended and i spoke to a democratic colleague of mine today ive been calling for a nofly zone to stop the barrel bombing and i asked this colleague of mine on the other side of the aisle if he would support that and he said yes he said i want to call it something else rather than a nofly zone but that this particular senator it is a fact that this particular senator has now changed his position and would like us to take action to present  to prevent the barrel bombing \\nwhat is your position about that and wouldnt it help if we took decisive action and ended this carnage \\nsecretary carter i dont know the specific proposal which youre discussing with your colleague ill make one comment and see if the chairman wants to add anything \\nsenator wicker i think he was talking about a nofly zone  \\nsecretary carter well okay \\nsenator wicker  but described in more palatable terms \\nsecretary carter there are  a number of different proposals have been made but i  the one that i think it the focus on right now is the one secretary kerrys trying to promote namely a nofly zone for the russians and the syrians who are attacking the syrian people if theyre talking about a nofly zone for american aircraft fighting isil needless to say that  thats not going to get any enthusiasm get strong opposition from me \\nsenator wicker im speaking about a  \\nsecretary carter but i think thats what a  but  its not called that but secretary kerry is trying to get a standdown of the syrian and russian air force and if hes successful that would be a good thing \\nlet me ask the chairman if he has anything to add \\ngeneral dunford senator the only thing id say is you know as the situation on the ground changes i think i have a responsibility  we the joint force has a responsibility  to make sure the president has a full range of options we have discussed that issue in the past under certain conditions the conditions on the ground will change and well continue to look at those options and make sure theyre available to the president \\nsenator wicker what about the option of controlling the airspace so that barrel bombs cannot be dropped \\ngeneral dunford all options  \\nsenator wicker what do you think of that option sir \\ngeneral dunford right now senator for all of the airspace in syria it would require war against syria and russia thats a pretty fundamental decision that certainly im not going to make \\n\\nconcluding remarks \\nfrom the above testimonies and statements one thing is clear decisionmakers at highest levels of the us government and the military believe in their own propaganda they are not able to reflect on their actions outside the realm of propaganda and this also applies to nuclear warfare which is presented as a peacemaking operation \\nit is unlikely that any drastic action regarding a no fly zone will be taken under the obama administration prior to the november elections and the instatement of a new president of the us in january  \\nconsequently the next three months will be absolutely crucial for syria ie during this period the counterterrorism campaign waged by syria with the support of russia and iran will seek to eliminate remaining terrorist pockets and pacify the entire country \\nthe footsoldiers of the western military alliance will be defeated on the ground if this objective is achieved it will inevitably have an impact on us options regarding the proposed deployment of groundforces and the no fly zone what prevails however is an attempt on the part of washington to redeploy its isis terrorist footsoldiers in mosul by transferring them from iraq to syria the original source of this article is global research',\n",

       " 'how they could steal the election from trump even if he is announced the winner next tuesday october   at  am \\nhow they could steal the election from trump even if he is announced the winner next tuesday \\nby dr patrick slattery  there has been a great deal of talk recently about the rigging of elections trump talks about it and then the media accuses him of being a threat to democracy by refusing to accept the will of the voters nobody asks hillary if she will accept the will of the voters \\nof course we know that our electoral system is unfair biased and even rigged at a variety of levels without going into detail the media which plays an absolutely crucial role in staging our elections has abandoned even the pretense of neutrality ballot access is unfair campaign finance is corrupt electronic voting machines are vulnerable voting by foreigners and dead people exists as does multiple voting by individuals \\nbut one massive threat has so far gone completely unmentioned the vulnerability of the electoral college to postelection shenanigans \\nwhat people are not aware of is that under the constitution the president is not elected on november  the tuesday after the first monday in november is designated for congressional elections it just so happens that over the years all the states decided to have their electors to the electoral college selected by the voters on that day in the early days of the republic it was actually more common for state legislatures to select the electors and the constitution allows the state legislatures to determine how the electors are selected \\nit is actually the electoral college that elects the president and that happens on the monday after the second wednesday in december which this year will be december  on this day the electors will meet in their respective state capitals to cast their ballots which will then be sent to washington to be opened by vice president biden before a joint session of congress on january  of next year some of you may remember the scene from michael moores fahrenheit  showing vice president gore reading votes that elected president bush ironically denying the objections raised by some congressmen to floridas electoral votes which bush won over gore amidst the greatest of controversy \\nso if this system is enshrined in the constitution what could possibly go wrong plenty \\nunless hillary goes into complete meltdown over the next week a trump victory on november  will likely be a narrow one in terms of the electoral college map one very plausible scenario has trump losing pennsylvania but winning the rest of the main battleground states plus one of maines congressional districts maine along with nebraska allow for electors to be elected on a congressional district basis rather than winnertakeall under this scenario  republican electors would be elected a bare majority while  democrat electors would be elected \\nnotice i did not say trump would get  electoral votes which is what we are used to hearing the fact is that the electoral votes are not cast until december  and there is no guarantee that every single one of the  republican electors would actually vote for trump do you remember a few months ago how alarmed we were at the prospect of supposed trump delegates to the republican national convention deserting trump and voting for cruz it was only that trump piled up such large victories in the final primaries that he had big enough majority of delegates to cause the never trump people in the republican establishment to give up on rigging the convention \\nso who are these electors just as the method of electing the electors is left up to the states the method for nominating the candidates for the electoral college is also left up to the states some states allow the presidential candidates to nominate their own slate of electors presumably these people could be counted on to be loyal but in other states the partys slate of electors is chosen at state party conventions and even electoral district conventions \\nas a young man i attended one such convention and had my name put into nomination as a democratic elector myself and the other three contenders then made short speeches to the convention the other three talked about being precinct captains or hardworking party volunteers then i gave a speech calling for the direct election of the president and the abolition of the electoral college i got a huge round of applause i would have easily won but as a matter of principle i withdrew my name from nomination \\nthe point of the story is that most of the electors are unknown to the public typically cogs in the party apparatus and not even necessarily highlevel ones and some of them may even be smoothtalking slicksters like me unknown to the party itself \\nso how likely is it that one or more republican electors would betray trump such a person is known as a faithless elector and while faithless electors have never ultimately altered the outcome of a presidential election there have been  faithless electors in our history in fact faithless electors caused the congress to have to decide the  election for vice president \\nit is true that about half the states have laws punishing faithless voters but in all but a few states the votes of faithless electors would still count \\nthe nightmare situation would be after a close election the hillary people or the never trump people could bribe or pressure republican electors some of whom may not like trump anyway not to vote for trump they could vote for hillary they could vote for pence they could vote for anyone else or they could even abstain from voting \\nthen what happens if enough republican electors are cajoled into voting for hillary in the above  scenario it would only require two then hillary gets inaugurated on january  if its a tie then the house of representatives breaks the tie obviously there have been republican members of the house that say they wont vote for trump for president in november so there is no reason to assume they would vote for him in january \\nhowever not only are republicans likely to retain a significant majority in the house but the voting for president by the house is not one vote for each representative but one vote per state this means that california which currently has  democratic representatives would get only one vote while alaskas single representative who is a republican would also get one vote this heavily favors the republicans and means that if hillary cannot flip enough republican electors to herself to win a majority of the electoral votes she is finished there is no real prospect of the house of representative electing hillary \\nbut what if enough republican electors vote for other people paul ryan for example so that no candidate gets a majority then the house of representatives gets to choose between the top three vote finishers in the electoral college vote you could get a coalition between democrats and republican defectors that would deny trump the presidency and give it to someone like ryan the same applies in the case that mormon excia operative and nevertrump independent presidential candidate evan mcmullen wins utah  which some polls predict is possible \\nwhile none of the above scenarios may come to pass we do have to face the fact that the establishment has so far stopped at nothing to try to defeat trump and so it is not too far fetched to think that they would try these tactics especially if the november  voting produces a very narrow victory for trump the media could start inventing more reasons why trump is uniquely unfit to become president and claim that the constitution allows for these scenarios which is the case and that this in fact was why the framers of the constitution created the electoral college which is not the case \\nit would then be incumbent on us to make it clear to the members of the electoral college and the congress that any violation of the peoples will would not be tolerated',\n",

respect and honor the diversity of mankind i believe that every people has the right to preserve their expression of humanity its own heritage and culture that every people on earth has the right rule themselves and the right to be free and independent \\nhuman freedom is the principle that all peoples must be free to be different humanity is not one it is many destroying the variety diversity and freedom of a diverse humanity is a destruction of humanity itself \\nnot recognizing the inborn urge of every people to express their essence in their own forms of art music culture religion societal structure and government leads to human conflict and often to violence and human suffering on a horrific scale \\nmuch of the worlds conflicts are not because peoples and cultures are different but because they are not allowed to be different because globalists and imperialists seek to expand their empires they want to control the resources and economy of all nations and destroy real human diversity human differences in values cultures economies religions and their freedom and independence to preserve and celebrated those differences stand in the way of the globalists who want to regiment mankind and make them soulless consumers human diversity is natural \\nhuman life is expressed in a multitude of diverse peoples created by geographic and social adaption over the course of thousands of years whether we celebrate human diversity as the handiwork of nature or in a religious sense as the creation of god we celebrate the rich tapestry of different peoples and cultures across the earth \\nwe believe that every people and culture has the right to preserve its unique expression of humanity that every people has the right to maintain and enrich its unique culture to nurture its particular expressions of art music literature philosophies architecture religion diet traditions and values that make every people unique and add beauty and possibility for mankind \\nwe believe that every people has the right to be politically free and independent and not be ruled over or exploited by any other people or nation and we reject the globalist power that seeks to destroy the independence and freedom of every people and destroy human diversity every people must have the right to self preservation and freedom \\nwe believe that every free people has the right to live in a harmonious society created in its own image its own nature and spirit \\nfor example the people of tibet have the human right to live in a society oriented to the heritage culture and tradition of that nation as should all peoples today the tibetan people are threatened by massive nontibetan immigration forced by an imperial power meant to marginalize the heritage and culture of tibetan people in their own homeland the loss of the unique people and culture of tibet is a horrific loss for them and truly a loss for all of humanity what is true for tibet and the tibetan people is true for every people on earth we believe that the people of tibet and every nation have the right to defend their borders and an inherent human right to preserve its unique ethnic and cultural character and its freedom and independence \\nnations more similar in their cultural ethnic religious and social traditions are tend to be far more harmonious that those wracked with internal cultural ethnic or religious divisions \\nwe also affirm that states with significant ethnic and cultural minorities tend to be more happy peaceful and cooperative when each group has the freedom to an autonomy that makes each group feel more at home in society \\nif one looks honestly at the world he quickly recognizes that the greatest source of civil conflict hatreds wars genocide and other horrific human rights violations comes from ethnic conflict often accompanied by religious conflict and when that happens it is like putting a fuse into dynamite \\nit is a truism that if you want to reduce ethnic conflict you must endeavor to give every people the human right to live and to create society and community in its own values and that every group respect the right of every other group to do this \\nwe believe that these endemic conflicts are rooted in supranational states and globalist denial of the reality of human diversity and denial of the natural human desire of people to live in a society reflecting their own heritage traditions culture and values one size does not fit all \\ninstead of recognizing this reality the globalists and empire builders seek to destroy the distinctions of humanity so they will become more compliant to their control and exploitation instead of accepting the reality of human nature and truly the diversity of all life including human life the globalists continue to promote destructive policies that destroy the harmony of traditional societies and historical character of nations massive immigration of diverse peoples into another peoples living space produces conflict not harmony \\nwe believe that massive forced immigration of nonindigenous people into other peoples lands is almost always against the will of the indigenous people \\nand this leads to civil repression conflict hatreds violence one does not have to look much further than the palestinian nakba or the massive immigration into tibet as examples of this universal truth but this reality is just as true in europe and other areas of the world that have undergone massive immigration into it regions and nation states \\nlook at the riots and deep social unrest and conflict that have befallen traditional harmonious societies that have experienced massive unwanted immigration \\na world of independent cultures is true diversity and freedom \\na multicultural state does not contribute to human diversity it does not contribute to human happiness peace and harmony it more often than not lessens human love and human rights no matter what the high motive it produces more disharmony than harmony more discord than accord \\njust as in the natural world every life form needs its own living space and needs the preservation of its own ecosystem to survive and flourish so it is true for every people of humanity \\nevery people needs a living space and ecocultural system in which it can thrive ignoring this reality leads to conflict diverse human peoples and cultures and religions competing in a limited living space is the greatest single cause of civil war and crimes against humanity \\nunited nations studies show ethnic cultural and religious conflicts within nations are the primary engines of civil conflict and war which takes an enormous toll in human suffering numbering hundreds of millions of dead injured and dispossessed human beings \\nthis urge to diversity has always been in mankind and always will be not to recognize this elemental part of mankinds nature is the progenitor of conflict \\nin fact with the rise of the idea that people have the right to be free ethnic conflict is increasing as the imperial states created by conquest can no longer repress the desire of diverse people for their freedom and ethnic expression \\nnations whose rulers have established immigration policies ignoring human differences are increasingly divided and conflicted trying to change the natural urge toward freedom is like screaming against the tide \\nthe global elite in government and media which has a huge stake in trying to regiment the worlds populations tell us we are all the same and they endeavor to destroy every unique culture and human expression  \\nthey attempt to change human nature but history and an increasingly conflicted world show that this is like screaming against the tide \\nbetter to recognize human nature and within that context support national and regional freedom that lessons conflict and supports mutual respect \\nit is time to teach the new ethic that recognizes the human right of every people to exist and thrive however those who seek their own peoples freedom must understand that these rights must be afforded to every people and any effort toward this worthy goal must be in the spirit of not destroying the rights of others and to peaceful resolution of the conflicts \\nit is far better to recognize these realities and inherent desires of humanity and avoid as much human conflict as possible than to try to destroy human distinctions in pursuit of imperialist empire or globalist regimentation and conformity even if the destruction of peoples is based on a utopian vision because it goes against basic human nature it ultimately leads not to a dreamed of peace and love between people but to conflict and hate attempts to control exploit or harm any people is a crime against humanity \\nwe must condemn violence and the harming or destruction of any people we must adopt a clear human ethic that attempts to control or exploit any other nation or people is a crime against humanity \\nwe support human freedom and we support human diversity and we support the right of every people to have their own nation or society but we do not support supremacism control or repression of any other people efforts to control or exploit is a crime against humanity \\nas a person of european descent i see that much of the repressive globalism damaging the world originates in mostly european peopled nations that are today called the west i see that this globalism not only damages and harms the worlds diversity of peoples but that it harms my own people and i have learned that we must not allow this exploitation of our own heritage and be just as committed to the well being of all of humanity \\nthis is a lifechanging lesson that i have learned in my own life as a very young man i joined a nonviolent klan organization in my community like so many young people across the world i longed to identify with my own people to defend the heritage that i love and that i believed was threatened \\nbut still as a young man i left the organization because i came to realize i have no moral right to speak about human rights for my own people unless i embrace the idea of the same human rights for every people and further that we must be committed to securing human rights not with war not with violence not with human suppression but the power of human ideas and ideals \\ni believe that the vast majority of the earths people believe in the principles i set forth here in my own life i further realized that other peoples have the same the desires for their own peoples heritage and rights that i have for mine \\ni realize fully that only in a context of genuine commitment to respect the rights and freedoms of all humanity can one morally campaign for your own peoples fundamental rights defending the diversity of humanity is a defense of humanity itself \\nthere is nothing wrong with a people defending their own rights and heritage in fact defending and preserving the diversity of humanity is defense of humanity itself \\nbut it must come with a genuine concern for the rights and heritage of all \\nin that context and only with that understanding can we move toward peaceful resolutions of social religious and ethnic conflicts and at the same time preserve our own heritage and the diversity and freedom of humanity \\nnations that have an overwhelmingly unifying heritage culture religious and social tradition have the right to preserve their expression of humanity and their societal harmony \\nit is a crime to destroy those values in pursuit of socalled multiculturalism and if one wants to see where massive immigration of alien peoples cultures and religions lead just look to what happened in the warravaged now dismembered nation once called yugoslavia look to the cultural and ethnic genocide in tibet look to the tribal and religious conflicts in many nations of the mideast \\ngroup differences run deep even though the muslim quran repeatedly teaches muslim unity still some extremist elements of shiites and sunnis blow up the children of each other in the others holy places of worship nor did the admonitions of jesus christ against violence and for love and reconciliation stop irish catholics and scottishderived protestants from a cascade of violence that has lead to the death of countless innocents \\nalthough we understand the historical motives of mass immigration of one people into another peoples lands we must not continue to repeat those mistakes in the modern world and create more divided and strifetorn communities regions and nations models of self rule and societal harmony \\nand just as a majority has the human right to live in a social fabric in harmony with its history and values so minorities must be accorded their human right to have their own communities or regions that reflect their own essence or helped to migrate to a sovereign region of compatriots \\nthis is human freedom and this is human rights on the most fundamental level those nations with significant minorities of diverse people should strive toward recognizing their desire for freedom and self expression \\nautonomy within nations such as the german language speaking south tyrol region of north italy and the italian french and germanspeaking cantons of switzerland offer models of how recognition of differences in language heritage ethnicity and a liberal degree of autonomy can lead to a more peaceful national fabric \\nnation states that seek imperial power through the conquering and subjection of other peoples are now coming apart at the seams because of the inherent will to freedom and identity that grow in suppressed people \\neven european nations divided by slight differences in history identity genetics and culture seek this freedom the artificially created nation of czechoslovakia was composed of czechs and slovaks held together by  years of intense totalitarian physical suppression propaganda and conditioning \\nwhen the communist tyranny collapsed they used their new freedom to create the independent states of the czech republic and the slovak republic \\nthey did this with mutual respect and not war and without horrific crimes against humanity \\ncontrast that to the artificially created state of yugoslavia created in name of empire and then held together under a ruthless authoritarian regime when communism fell people wedded to old ideas of empire tried desperately to hold on to control over vast areas of diverse peoples as a result a long war and brutality and massive crimes against humanity occurred on both sides of the conflict \\nhow much better if all parties in the conflict had embraced the ethic that all people have a right to self rule and self expression in their own regions take for example two of the many peoples trapped in the old yugoslavia the serbians and the croatians even though serbians may have dominated the government of yugoslavia to effectively control other peoples such a totalitarian state must suppress the natural differences in people and force a regimentation and conformity \\nso even the serbian people lost some of their unique identity as well as the other peoples over whom they ruled people now warmly embrace the right of serbians and croatians to be themselves and rule themselves globalism is a continuation of yugoslavian totalitarianism on a global scale \\nironically the serbians and the croatians and indeed all of us face globalist tyrants demanding to control the economy of serbia and croatia their currencies controlled by new york and london rather than by their own people and increasingly they are subject to a media controlled by hollywood and new york rather than the spirit of their own traditional heritage and values \\nand in the height of insanity the globalists are eyeing mass immigration into both serbia and croatia of massive numbers of noneuropean immigrants who are far more fundamentally different than serbs and croats a prescription for future human conflict the rights of both majorities and minorities \\nthere are many harmonious nations on earth that are overwhelmingly of one primary heritage with only minor differences among their inhabitants \\nbut nations corrupted by the globalist power and media elite and propagandized that humanity is one and not many go against the peoples will and usher in massive immigration of an alien population \\nthis process is almost always against the democratic will of the nations inhabitants as history repeatedly shows and then as the numbers increase and societal differences and conflicts and discord increase the globalists resort to the old totalitarian tactics of suppressing free speech free association and all kinds of human liberty even to the point of forbidding the public displays of the traditional culture of the vast majority \\na powerful example is how the american government has now made it illegal to display a christian christmas motif on public ground even in an overwhelmingly christian cultural nation america supposedly created by e pluribus unum out of the many one is now dominated by identity and ethnic politics \\nthe most powerful lobby in american politics by far is for instance the jewish lobby comprised of an ethnic group of two percent of the american people but driven by ethnic and religious supremacism jewish organizations lead the fight in the destruction of christian christmas traditions \\nthe political landscape of america is dominated by special interest groups to which every politician must now bow except of course the european american majority which must silently watch as its cultural traditions such as christmas are destroyed of course it goes far beyond christmas americans are experiencing increasing identity politics and division such as generated by massive illegal immigration the rights of small nations cannot be sacrificed \\non the international level it must be recognized as a crime against humanity for any imperial state to occupy another peoples lands for exploitation of its labor or resources where autonomy or independent regions are not possible a degree of autonomy is certainly possible where significant groups in an area can have community institutions schools and other structures oriented toward both their needs and their spirit \\nit is time to stand for freedom for all peoples it is time to stand up to globalist destruction of biodiversity destruction of human diversity destruction of the earths indigenous cultures artistic expressions lifestyles traditions and independence zionist globalism is actually supremacism \\nthe globalists seek the destruction of every unique expression of humanity they want to destroy the unique character of your people and every people on the earth \\nthey seek to destroy the human diversity of the earth so they can more easily rule over all of us and market the same brands of junk movies media and music they want you and all of us to consume the same junk food from a world agribusiness and media that advertises it that not only destroys the planets ecosystems but destroys your health and the health of hundreds of millions of people spawning epidemics of obesity heart disease diabetes and other ills \\nthey want to control the value of the currency in your pocket and force you and your nation under a corrupt zionistcontrolled global banking system that exploits you and all of us and put whole nations and peoples as slaves in a perpetual debt \\nthey want to put you and all of us under a soulless globalist government that takes away your freedom and that of every people and every nation \\nand these globalists want war perpetual wars and conflicts in their attempts to expand their power over the earth and over all people \\nthey grow stronger by divide and conquer tactics and they seek to stamp out human diversity and seek to regiment all of humanity to their new world order all while the new york centered globalist media supports israel as a quote jewish state and supports zionist control of the international banks and the globalist media so in reality zionistdriven globalism is actually form of jewish supremacism \\nglobalism is imperialism on a global level and the greatest threat to human freedom diversity and independence in all of world history yes to freedom yes to diversity and independence \\nbut my dear friends all over the world in my homeland of america and that of my brethren in europe but among all freedom loving people across the globe millions of us say no to globalism \\nwe say yes to freedom yes to human diversity and independence \\nwe say no to globalist wars such as the iraq war the

       " ' views share by dr david duke when i was first began to understand the ultraracist supremacist ideology of judaism and zionism i came into contact with the theory that presentday jews are genetically unrelated to the historical jewish community the allegation known as the khazar theory claims that the ashkenazim jews of today are actually the descendants of the khazar people a central asiatic nomadic tribe that allegedly converted to judaism in the th century ad it is claimed that these newlyminted jews then migrated into what is now russia eastern europe and later western and northern europe the theory is also used to advance the idea that jewish actions are character are not genetic or racial because the khazar people adopted the talmudic values of shephardic and other jews who were unrelated to them interestingly enough the khazar theory was launched and is still to this day driven primarily by communist jews and other jews who promote it in the gentile community as a refutation that the jews cant be racist because they are not a race it is ironic that the three most prominent exponents of the theory that the jews are not a race all have almost exaggerated caricatures of features people ascribe as jewish above left to right zionist extremist and communist party member arthur koestler author of the the thirteenth tribe jewish geneticist eran elhaik and shlomo sand an israeli academic and former member of the union of israeli communist youth banki all three maintain that large numbers of presentday jews are completely genetically unrelated to the middle easternorigin jews who wrote the babylonian talmud \\nfor years i accepted the khazar theory as true after it all it was repeated by some writers who also recognized the leading jewish role in communism and their leadership in many other subversive movements it was only later when i considered the question logically and scientifically were my doubts about the khazar theory aroused one thing that i did not know then was that koestler the communist jew who popularized the khazar theory bragged in a jewish magazine that he advanced the theory as way to fight against antisemitism his theory was that since the gospels and europeans blamed jews for the crucifixion of jesus christ if he could make europeans believe that they are not related by blood to the christkiller jews talked about in the new testament that he could lessen hatred against jews one must remember until the jewish triumph of christian zionism  percent of christianity viewed jews as the greatest enemies of jesus christ and god as the new testament makes very very clear so in those days some jews such as koestler saw an advantage to say that the jews were not actually related to the jews who crucified christ and so persecuted christians koestlers official biography written by michael scammell specifically quotes him on why he wrote the thirteenth tribe  his argument was that if he could persuade people that a nonjewish khazar heritage formed the basis of modern jews then this would be a weapon against european raciallybased antisemitism should this theory be confirmed the term antisemitism would become void of meaning he said according to scammell koestler told french biologist pierre debrayritzen he was convinced that if he could prove that the bulk of eastern european jews were descended from the khazars the racial basis for antisemitism would be removed and antisemitism itself could disappear source scammell michael koestler the literary and political odyssey of a twentiethcentury skeptic random house  isbn  p  in the s the khazar theory was also promoted by benjamin friedman a prominent rich jew who converted to christianity and turned against the jews it was certainly selfserving for

study titled jewish and middle eastern nonjewish populations share a common pool of ychromosome biallelic haplotypes  mf hammer etal proceedings of the us national academy of sciences  doi pnas  found that despite their longterm residence in different countries and isolation from one another most jewish populations were not significantly different from one another at the genetic level admixture estimates suggested low levels of european ychromosome gene flow into ashkenazi and roman jewish communities    jewish and middle eastern nonjewish populations were not statistically different the results support the hypothesis that the paternal gene pools of jewish communities from europe north africa and the middle east descended from a common middle eastern ancestral population and suggest that most jewish communities have remained relatively isolated from neighboring nonjewish communities during and after the diaspora  a november  study titled the y chromosome pool of jews as part of the genetic landscape of the middle east  almut nebel et al american journal of human genetics nov     found that in most jewish populations male line ancestors appear to have been mainly middle eastern the study found that ashkenazi jews in particular share more common paternal lineages with other jewish and middle eastern groups than with nonjewish populations in areas where jews lived in eastern europe germany and the french rhine valley this is consistent with jewish traditions in placing most jewish paternal origins in the region of the middle east  a september  study titled european population substructure clustering of northern and southern populations  michael f seldin etal plos genetics doi journalpgen  found that both ashkenazi jews as well as sephardic jews showed more than  membership in the southern european group which made their results consistent with a later mediterranean origin of these ethnic groups  an april  study titled counting the founders the matrilineal genetic ancestry of the jewish diaspora  doron m behar etal plos one   e doi journalpone  found that about  of ashkenazi jews originate maternally from just four female founders who were

microsatellites identify shared jewish ancestry intermediate between middle eastern and european populations  naama m kopelman etal bmc genetics    doi   found that  jewish populations show a high level of genetic similarity to each other clustering together in several types of analysis of population structure these results support the view that the jewish populations largely share a common

world nonjewish populations in order to provide comprehensive comparisons between jewish and nonjewish populations in the diaspora as well as with nonjewish populations from the middle east and north

jewry this study found used genomewide analysis of seven jewish groups iranian iraqi syrian italian turkish greek and ashkenazi and demonstrated distinctive jewish population clusters each with shared middle eastern ancestry proximity to contemporary middle eastern populations and variable degrees of european and north african admixture this paper specifically excluded the khazar theory as an origin for presentday jews saying the genetic proximity    is incompatible with theories that ashkenazi jews are for the most part the direct lineal descendants of converted khazars or slavs  a march  study by steven m bray et al titled signatures of founder effects admixture and selection in the ashkenazi jewish population  proceedings of the us national academy of sciences  doi pnas  found that the ashkenazi jewish aj population    has a common middle eastern origin with other jewish diaspora populations while concluding that the ashkenazi jewish population has had the most european

of local populations followed by genetic isolation with the rise of christianity and then islam and admixture following the emigration of sephardic jews during the inquisition finally this study added  these populations showed a high degree of endogamy and were part of a larger ashkenazi and sephardic jewish group endogamy the practice of marrying within a specific ethnic group rejecting others on such a basis as being unsuitable for marriage or for other close personal relationships  in his book legacy a genetic history of the jewish people oxford university press usa may  harry ostrer a

genomic testing at montefiore medical center said in his conclusion that jews are a homogeneous group with all the scientific trappings of what we used to call a race ostrer also deals specifically with the khazar theory he pointed out that the findings from the jewish hapmap project see below completely refute the theories that ashkenazi jews are the descendants of converted khazars or slavs  jews a religious group people or race jerusalem post    the jewish hapmap project  a joint project of albert einstein college of medicine and new york university school of medicine was created to understand the structure of the genomes in jewish populations and is an outgrowth of the human hapmap project according to this project jewish populations are remarkable for maintaining continuous genetic cultural and religious traditions over  years despite residence all over the world its findings based on first hand dna studies amongst jewish populations around the globe found no evidence to support a central asian dna origin for jewry according to the jerusalem post the jewish hapmap project in new york city has so far shown in exquisite detail what had been conjectured for a century jewish populations from the major jewish diaspora groups  ashkenazi sephardic and mizrahi  form a distinctive population cluster that is closely related to semitic and european populations within this larger jewish cluster each of the jewish populations formed its own subcluster a high degree of mixing of ashkenazi sephardi italian and syrian jews caused them to become more closely related to each other than they were to middle eastern iraqi and iranian jews this genetic split seemed to have occurred about  years ago  jews a religious group people or race jerusalem post   dna studies find that ashkenazim jews have  european admixture both the behar study section  above and the atzmon study section  above were commented upon by the british former deputy editor of the journal nature  and currently the scientific correspondent for the n ew york times  nicholas wade in an article in that newspaper as follows jewish communities in europe and the middle east share many genes inherited from the ancestral jewish population that lived in the middle east some  years ago even though each community also carries genes from other sources  usually the country in which it lives adding that a major surprise from both surveys is the genetic closeness of the two jewish communities of europe the ashkenazim and the sephardim wade pointed out that the two studies refute the suggestion made by the historian shlomo sand in his book the invention of the jewish people that jews have no common origin but are a miscellany of people in europe and central asia who converted to judaism at various times jewish communities from europe the middle east and the caucasus all have substantial genetic ancestry that traces back to the levant ethiopian jews and two judaic communities in india are genetically much closer to their host populations wade wrote the shared genetic elements suggest that members of any jewish community are related to one another as closely as are fourth or fifth cousins in a large population which is about  times higher than the relationship between two people chosen at random off the streets of new york city ashkenazic and sephardic jews have roughly  percent european ancestry with most of the rest from the middle east the two surveys find the two communities seem very similar to each other genetically which is unexpected because they have been separated for so long  studies show jews genetic similarity nicholas wade new york times june    eran elhaiks single study attempts to refute the mass of earlier dna evidence the mass of dna and genetic evidence is therefore overwhelmingly indicative that despite a certain amount of european admixture among ashkenazim jewry there is still a clearly definable middle eastern genetic component to both ashkenazim and sephardic jewry despite all of these studiesand many more too numerous to list individually herein december  a single individual by the name of eran elhaik from the johns hopkins university school of medicine attempted to refute all of the above mentioned evidence his paper titled the missing link of jewish european ancestry contrasting the rhineland and the khazarian hypotheses was published in the journal genome biological evolution    doi gbeevs  in a nutshell elhaikwhose rather obviously jewish physical appearance should by itself indicate that there is indeed a common jewish type how else can many jews be physically recognized as jewsargues that his method of doing comparative studies between presentday central asian populations ashkenazim jews and nonjewish test groups proves that ashkenazim jews are a hotchpotch of genetic origins with a strong link to what he identifies as the khazar tribe even though elhaiks work is the only single paper as opposed to literally dozens of opposing dna studies written by a single jewish individual as opposed to the other papers which were written by dozens and dozens of scientists from around the globe jewish and nonjewish alike it has quickly become the mostquoted proof of the khazar theory critical errors in elhaiks paper elhaiks paper has a number of errors some small and a number of major ones but they are all serious because even the small errors cast doubt on his academic ability and motivation for example his paper discusses in detail what he sees as the geographic origin of the khazarsyet he completely misidentifies the geographic location of one of his test sample groups the mbuti and biaka pygmies these two groups elhaik asserts at least twice are to be found in south africa actually the mbuti and biaka pygmies are nowhere near south africa and are only to be found literally half a continent away in the congo while this may seem a small error it does indicate sloppiness in research which certainly does not bode well for the rest of the paper this sloppiness is again repeated when elhaik asserts that eastern and central european jews account for approximately  of over  million worldwide jews in reality the figure is far less of the estimated  million jews worldwide  million are ashkenazim and  million are sephardic a division of  european jews to  noneuropean jews and it should be pointed out that the zionist state of israel actually has a sephardic and mizrahi nonashkenazi jewish majority among jews these actual facts on jewish ethnicity are readily available and elhaiks motivation for making this clearly false claim could only be ascribed to a desire to underscore his general assertion namely that most jews are not middle eastern in origin and that jews are not race or a genetically similar people the most important error in elhaiks paper however is actually openly admitted namely that there is actually no khazar dna in existence against which any sort of measurement can be taken elhaik himself admits this in his paper the khazars have been vanquished and their remains have yet to be sequenced   in other words there is no record of what exactly khazar dna might have been as there is no record of what khazar dna isit is ipso facto physically impossible to determine who is descended from it and who is not elhaik attempts to circumvent this major problem by selecting what he calls surrogate populationsin this case contemporary middle eastern and caucasus populations anyone with a basic understanding of historical events in the caucasus in particular will immediately see that elhaiks assertion that current populations in that region can be taken to reflect those of  years ago is highly problematic and quite simply unsustainable the caucasus a region at the border of europe and asia situated between the black and the caspian seas has been crisscrossed by numerous peoples and races over the last  years ranging from indoeuropeans semites mongols and othersand is today highly genetically diverse a claim that dna samples from this region can be taken as any sort of dna yardstick is dubious to say the very least finally elhaiks methodology in comparing the dna samples is to make an understatement unique to him as marcus feldman director of stanford universitys morrison institute for population and resource studies said he elhaik appears to be applying the statistics in a way that gives him different results from what everybody else has obtained from essentially similar data  jews a race genetic theory comes under fierce attack by dna expert the jewish daily forward may    interestingly the study which was cited in the new york times of the jews as a race is exactly the same conclusion that was reached by german national socialist anthropologists and other experts who studied race science in the united states and elsewhere also many of the presentday extensive studies have been carried out by both gentile and jewish geneticists alike obviating any claims of racial bias elhaiks theory is completely refuted by the new most massive and most complete study ever done of the jewish genome one of elhaiks arguments was that the previous studies referenced above were done in the pregenomewide era using uniparental markers and including different reference populationsimplying that their results are not in line with the most modern dna sequencing methodology in fact at least one studywhich appeared after elhaiks work was first publishedhas confirmed the accuracy of the original studies and also completely refuted elhaiks hypothesis titled no evidence from genomewide data of a khazar origin for the ashkenazi jews this study was published by the journal human biology in august  behar doron m etal human biology access preprints paper   this paper emphasized the serious error with elhaiks work because the khazar population has left no obvious modern descendants that could enable a clear test for a contribution to ashkenazi jewish ancestry the khazar hypothesis has been difficult to examine using genetics furthermore because only limited genetic data have been available from the caucasus region and because these data have been concentrated in populations that are genetically close to populations from the middle east the attribution of any signal of ashkenazicaucasus genetic similarity to khazar ancestry rather than shared ancestral middle eastern ancestry has been problematic this latest most massive study of the jewish genome was a worldwide effort of geneticists both gentile and jewish to analyze jewish genetics researchers from laboratories around the globe including estonia russia italy greece bosnia and herzegovina croatia armenia the us and israel gathered together the largest jewish dna data set ever yet assembled the paper explained as follows here through integration of genotypes on newly collected samples with data from several of our past studies we have assembled the largest data set available to date for assessment of ashkenazi jewish genetic origins employing a variety of standard techniques for the analysis of population genetic structure we find that ashkenazi jews share the greatest genetic ancestry with other jewish populations and among nonjewish populations with groups from europe and the middle east no particular similarity of ashkenazi jews with populations from the caucasus is evident particularly with the populations that most closely represent the khazar region thus analysis of ashkenazi jews together with a large sample from the region of the khazar khaganate corroborates the earlier results that ashkenazi jews derive their ancestry primarily from populations of the middle east and europe that they possess considerable shared ancestry with other jewish populations and that there is no indication of a significant genetic contribution either from within or from north of the caucasus region the latest most uptodate and modern dna analysis has therefore completely refuted the khazar theory it is important to understand that this refutation has come from nonjewish and jewish scientists from dozens of different universities and geneticists all over the world and cannot be ascribed to a conspiracy part ii the historicallogical evidence the historical record shows jewish physical consistency one of the most obvious indicators of genetic commonality is physical appearance european people broadly resemble each other african people broadly resemble each other chinese people broadly resemble each other australian aborigines broadly resemble each other and so on it is a characteristic of genetically similar people to physically resemble each other jews are no different in this regard to any other people they too show a resemblance to each otherthis is why it is possible to often recognize a jewish person by his physical appearance a good example in point is the already mentioned jewish geneticist eran elhaik who despite physically embodying a jewish sterrotype recognized around the world tries to claim that there is no genetic commonality amongst jews the khazar theory holds that most ashkenazim jews are not semitic but are central asian converts to judaism proponents of the khazar theory fail to understand the logical consequence of their beliefnamely that a supposed central asian origin of most ashkenazim jews means that they will not physically resemble other jews as anyone can see this is not the case sephardic jews are on average slightly darker than ashkenazim jews but there is no doubt that there is a physical similarity which allows them still to be recognized as such above these two illustrations make the point even more dramatically on the left the ashkenazim jewess barbara streisand new york  on the right a jewish leader of israelite trade delegation as portrayed on a mural on the wall of the th dynasty  bc tomb of sobekhotep thutmose iv egypt two thousand years before the alleged khazar conversion and they look the same as modern ashkenazi jews streisands paternal grandparents came from galicia polandukraine and her maternal grandparents came from russiaif anyone would be khazar according to that theory it would be her nonetheless she closely resembles the only designated jew as portrayed on an egyptian tomb from  years ago the leader of a jewish trade delegation to egypt the genetic continuity is clearand if the khazar theory was true there would be no physical similarity because there would have been a racial sea change in jewish appearance left the famous banker of pompeii jucundus who lived circa  ad  years before the alleged ashkenazi conversion identified as a jew by the german anthropologist hans fk günther in his book  racial elements of european history fig a and b chapter viii  alongside the ashkenazi jew abe foxman of the adl the similarity between jucundus and foxman is clear and serves a further indication of the physical continuity of the jewish type over centuriessomething that would be impossible if the khazar theory was true in addition to genetic studies there have been extensive physiological comparison of jewish remains from burial sites from ancient israel and presentday ashkenazi and sephardic physiology all of which conclusively shows their similarity across both the sephardic and ashkenazi spectrumand their difference from european populations jewish supremacist behavior through the millennia disprove the khazar theory another piece of the jigsaw which disproves the khazar theory is that jewish supremacist behavior has remained constant throughout the millenniafrom biblical times right through to the present day most christians are aware of the behavior of the old testament jewswho burn rampage kill rape and enslave their way through palestine supposedly on order of their tribal god they are aware of the fact that the gospels of the new testament show that elite of the jews the pharisees were the biggest enemies of christ and arranged for his crucifixion and the new testament is clear that they led the persecution of christians which has continued through both jewish bolshevism and the cultural assault in the zio global media it must also be clear that the talmud the books of jewish law promoting jewish extremist supremacism and hatred against all nonjews was written hundreds of years before any alleged khazar conversion while it another debate altogether as to the historical accuracy of those events there is no question about jewish interaction with gentilesand romans in particularduring the first century ad the worlds first antijewish riots broke out in the city of alexandria in  ad and reoccurred in  ad  ad  ad and  ad in that year the archbishop of alexandria cyril ordered the expulsion of all jews from the city the roman historian socrates of constantinople not be confused with the socrates of classical greece in his ecclesiastical history recorded the reasons for this first great expulsion of jews from a nonjewish city in detail and reveals behavior by jewish supremacists exactly as the world experiences it today over  years later   the jews were continually factious and there was added to their ordinary hatred of the christians    cyril on being informed of this sent for the principal jews and threatened them with the utmost severities unless they desisted from their molestation of the christians these menaces instead of suppressing their violence only rendered the jewish populace more furious and led them to form conspiracies for the destruction of the christians one of which was of so desperate a character as to cause their entire expulsion from alexandria socrates hist eccl vii  pc lxxxii  ff the very first jewish community outside of the middle east was established in rome in  bcand it was not long before their activities roused roman public opinion against them the famous orator cicero among others frequently spoke against the presence of jews during sittings of the roman senate in his famous pro flacco oration which dealt with the case of a roman aristocrat lucius valerius flaccus accused of unlawfully confiscating jewish money cicero said now let us take a look at the jews and their mania for gold you chose this site chief prosecutor laelius and the crowd which frequents it with an eye to this particular accusation knowing very well that jews with their large numbers and tendency to act as a clique are valuable supporters to have at any kind of public meeting many other prominent and famous romans such as seneca juneval and tacitus all went on record as complaining about the activities of jews within the roman empire the roman historian tacitus in his most famous work histories described the activities of the jews as follows in order to secure the allegiance of his people in the future moses prescribed for them a novel religion quite different from those of the rest of mankind among the jews all things are profane that we hold sacred on the other hand they regard as permissible what seems to us immoral    the other practices of the jews are sinister and revolting and have entrenched themselves by their very wickedness wretches of the most abandoned kind who had no use for the religion of their fathers took to contributing dues and freewill offerings to swell the jewish exchequer and other reasons for their increasing wealth may be found in their stubborn loyalty and ready benevolence towards brother jews but the rest of the world they confront with the hatred reserved for enemies they will not feed or intermarry with gentiles though a most lascivious people the jews avoid sexual intercourse with women of alien race among themselves nothing is barred they have introduced the practice of circumcision to show that they are different from others tacitus histories  the famous british historian edward gibbon in his monumental work the decline and fall of the roman empire lippincourt philadelphia  vol  page  discussed jewish supremacist behavior in roman times this way from the reign of nero to that of antoninus pius the jews discovered a fierce impatience of the dominion of rome which repeatedly broke out in the most furious massacres and insurrections humanity is shocked at the recital of horrid cruelties which they committed in the cities of egypt of cyria and of cyrene where they dwelt in treacherous friendship with the unsuspecting natives and we are tempted to applaud the severe retaliation which was exercised by the arms of the legions against a race of fanatics whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to render them the implacable enemies not only of the roman government but of all human kind antijewish literature during roman times was very widespread one work by the greek apion was so wellknown that the romanized jewish historian josephus who wrote the famous account of the jewish uprising of  ad called the jewish wars wrote an entire book trying to refute apions arguments the roman emperor tiberius formally expelled the jews from rome in  ad they returned shortly thereafter only to be expelled once again in  ad in  ad emperor trajan ordered that all jews in mesopotamia should be killed saying that they were the cause of continual uprisings in that region one of the most famous emperors of the eastern roman empire justinian  ad adopted a comprehensive antijewish policy which barred jews from the civil service military posts and any other positions of influence in his government all of these events predate the supposed khazar conversion by centuriesyet it can be seen that the identical behavioral patterns are on display before and after the supposed khazar infusion logic dictates that if the racial makeup of jews changed substantially after the year  ad then their beh',\n",

draw the line though \\nelias suggests a particularly intricate solution \\nif we do it case by case then it will be subjective we would look at who the donor is and what foreign entity they are registered for in judging whether to take the money we would consider the relationship between that country and the united states its relationship to the state department during hillarys time as secretary and its relationship if any to the foundation in judging the individual we would look at their history of support for political candidates generally and hillarys past campaigns specifically

choose hillary then they must and will be punished wikileaks bill clinton boasts of hillarys working relationship with muslim brotherhood by john hayward breitbart  october   \\nin a speech bill clinton gave at the home of mehul and hema sanghani in october  revealed to the public for the first time by wikileaks former president bill clinton touted hillary clintons working relationship with the muslim brotherhoods mohamed morsi in egypt as an example of her diplomatic skillspresident clinton also gave his wife a lot of credit for negotiating the iran nuclear deal in a passage that began with the standard democrat stuff happens shrugging defense for foreign policy failures \\nfinally we live in a world as i said thats full of good news and bad news the united states cannot control it all but we need a president whos most likely to make as many good things happen as possible and most likely to prevent big bad things from happening you cant keep every bad thing from happening whos most likely to be able to get people involved in a positive way even the people who dont like the iran nuclear agreement concede it never would have happened if it hadnt been for the sanctions hillary negotiated those sanctions and got china and russia to sign off  something i thought shed never be able to do i confess im never surprised by anything she does but that surprised me i didnt think she could do it the chinese and the russians to see past their shortterm selfinterest to their longterm interest and not sparking another nuclear arms race \\nand when the muslim brotherhood took over in egypt in spite of the fact that we were inaudible she developed a working relationship with the thenpresident and went there and brokered a ceasefire to stop a fullscale shooting war between israel and hamas in gaza which on top of what was going on in syria and the inaudible jordan would have been a calamity for the world \\nand when we were trying to reset our relations with russia under president medvedev she and her team negotiated a new start treaty which limits warheads and missiles and she lobbied it through the senate she had to get  votes which means a lot of these republicans who say that they dont like her now are just kidding for election season they trusted her and she got it passed you cant get  votes in the senate without a lot of republican support and i dont know about you but with all this tension and mr putin trying to affect the outcome of the conflict in syria i think its a very good thing that were in a lower risk of any kind of accidental nuclear conflict with the russians she did that \\nyoull rarely find a more tortured political framing of the iran debacle than bill clinton boasting that the sanctions barack obama lifted were superawesome as even those who dont think those sanctions should have been lifted agree \\nmr clintons version of the iran sanctions leaves out a few details  such as russias keen financial interest in keeping iranian energy out of the european market and chinas desire to use iran sanctions as a geopolitical bargaining chip \\nbut the part about the muslim brotherhood is most interesting if anything he is selling hillary clintons working relationship with egyptian islamists short because she used american diplomatic leverage for morsis benefit even before he got elected warning egyptians about backtracking to a military regime at a key moment of the postmubarak campaign when morsi was running against a former member of hosni mubaraks military there have long been rumors that more subtle forms of us  pressure  were used to secure morsis office as well \\nthen again in public pronouncements clinton called hosni mubaraks tottering regime stable and cautioned her obama administration colleagues against pushing a longtime partner out the door \\na few days ago declassified state department documents revealed clintons talking points for a  meeting with morsi hailed his election as a milestone in egypts transition to democracy and stated that she was to offer the muslim brotherhood leader technical expertise and assistance from both the us government and private sector to support his economic and social programs \\nclinton was also supposed to privately offer morsi assistance with his police and security forces which would be conducted quite discreetly \\nafter morsi was gone she declared herself exasperated with egyptian political culture and declared herself a cynical realist that is pretty much the opposite of what everyone in the obama administration was saying while the arab spring was in the midst of springing its little surprises on autocratic but americaaligned or at least americafearing regimes which we were all supposed to feel guilty about selfishly supporting for so long \\nas for clintons superb working relationship with morsi that eventually ended with morsis wife railing against clinton for supposedly dismissing him as a simpleton who was unfit for the presidency and threatening to publish letters from clinton to morsi that would damage the former us secretary of state meanwhile mohammed morsi is developing a solid working relationship with the egyptian penitentiary system  \\negypt has one of those icky military governments again and while it wont have fond memories of hillary clintons support for the muslim brotherhood regime it will most likely work with whoever wins the  us presidential election therefore a prospective president hillary clinton probably wont suffer too much from secretary of state hillary clintons appalling

spray mace a number of atvs five tanks two helicopters and militaryequipped humvees showed up to tear down an encampment of standing rock sioux water protectors and supporters armed with  nothing \\nunder orders from the nownotorious morton county sheriffs office this ridiculously heavyhanded standing army came better prepared to do battle than some actual military units fighting overseas \\nbut the target of their operation  a group of slightly more than  native american water protectors and supporters opposing construction of the dakota access pipeline  never intended to do battle with the armed taxpayerfunded corporatebacked statesponsored aggressors \\nreports vary but no less than  people were arrested thursday and  according to witnesses  police marked numbers on arrestees arms and housed them in cementfloored dog kennels  without any padding before they were transported as far away as fargo \\nit goes back to concentration camp days asserted ocetisakowin coordinator mekasi camphorinek who along with his mother was marked and detained in a mesh kennel reports the los angeles times  \\nalthough thursdays incident remained relatively peaceful for some time with only shouts chants and occasional attempts by water protectors to convince this standing army to examine its motives and reconsider clashes nonetheless broke out  solely because of gratuitous police aggression \\nafter facing off for a couple hours these militant cops began closing in on the water protectors to shut down the treaty of  camp  in reference to the fort laramie treaty of that year which established a large parcel of land designated exclusively native american territory not to be disturbed by the us government prior to his arrest camphorinek had established the camp stating as cited by indigenous rising  \\ntoday the oceti sakowin has enacted eminent domain on dapl lands claiming  treaty rights this is unceded land highway  as of this point is blockaded we will be occupying this land and staying here until this pipeline is permanently stopped we need bodies and we need people who are trained in nonviolent direct action we are still staying nonviolent and we are still staying peaceful \\ndespite the water protectors commitment to nonviolence the militarized police response went as would be expected  horribly awry \\na prayer circle of elders including several women was interrupted and all were arrested for standing peacefully on the public road stated a press release from indigenous environment network a tipi was erected in the road and was recklessly dismantled despite law enforcement statements that they would merely mark the tipi with a yellow ribbon and ask its owners to retrieve it a group of water protectors was also dragged out of a sweat lodge ceremony erected in the path of the pipeline thrown to the ground and arrested \\nclaims to the contrary by morton county sheriff kyle kirchmeier aside native american and indigenous water protectors and supporters have refrained from violent acts on the whole preferring instead peaceful prayer vigils and acts of civil disobedience \\nno matter how peacefully the opposition acts armed defenders of big oil interests seem determined to brutalize  disrespect and generally incite and inflict violence against those who desire unsullied water for generations to come \\nin fact at the beginning of september a private security firm hired by energy transfer partners the company responsible for pipeline construction indiscriminately unleashed vicious attack dogs on water protectors press and supporters  for reasons as yet unknown \\nduring the savage attack a pregnant woman young girl and many others suffered serious dog bites thanks to the ineptitude of the dogs handlers afterward a warrant for inciting a riot was issued democracy now journalist amy goodman  for doing her job filming events as they happened  though charges were subsequently thrown out \\nalthough etp and some law enforcement officers defended the barbarous actions of the private security mercenaries the guardian now reports that  because the guards lacked proper licensing  they could now face criminal charges

frost kennels told the guardian  all the proper protocols  were already done i pulled my guys out the next day because we werent there to go to war with these protesters \\nfrost insisted he had cooperated with authorities investigating the incident  but the sheriffs department disagrees seven handlers and dogs were deployed to the scene in early september allegedly in response to reports of trespassers but according to the guardian  police have only managed to identify two people \\nthe sheriffs department claims frost has not provided necessary information and unnamed security officials cited in the report said that there were no intentions of using the dogs or handlers for security work  however because of the protest events the dogs were deployed as a method of trying to keep the protesters under control \\nin a statement cited by the guardian  morton county captain jay gruebele said although lists of security employees have been provided there is no way of confirming whether the list is accurate or if names have been purposely withheld \\nwater protectors in the meantime are left to deal with absurdly disproportionate state violence  and the altogether unacceptable

mishandling of the lois lernerirs debacle first there was the secret airplane meeting with bill clinton \\nit all started to publicly go downhill for lynch during the first investigation into hillary clintons carelessness with national secrets via her home email server  right before fbi director james comey was to meet with hillary clinton to interrogate her about the subject lynch was busted having a secret meeting with bill clinton  the washington post reported \\nclintons private unplanned meeting with attorney general loretta e lynch at the phoenix airport last week coming at a time when the justice department should be nearing completion of its examination of hillary clintons use of a private server for her emails as secretary of state will inevitably  and negatively  affect public attitudes about that investigation \\nlynch has tried to make amends though not without leaving some confusion in her wake in a conversation friday with washington post editorial writer jonathan capehart at the aspen ideas festival she insisted again that the conversation was innocent  about grandchildren and golf and such  and did not touch on the investigation of the emails but she said she recognized that others would not see it that way the fact that the meeting that i had is now casting a shadow over how people are going to view that work is something that i take seriously and deeply and painfully she said \\nlynch said that she would be accepting whatever recommendation the career prosecutors and fbi director james b comey bring her  though she did not say she would remove herself completely from the case she also said she had made that decision some months ago but was only now making it public \\nof course it was all much easier for lynch to abide by the decision when comey miraculously found that hillary clinton was not criminal in her negligence with national secrets \\nnow though people are asking questions about that illfounded meeting judicial watch has filed a lawsuit for all records related to the illicit meeting between attorney general lynch and former president bill clinton  \\non june   attorney general loretta lynch is reported to have met privately with former president bill clinton on board a parked private plane at sky harbor international airport in phoenix arizona the meeting occurred during the thenongoing investigation of mrs clintons email server and mere hours before the benghazi report was released publicly involving both mrs clinton and the obama administration judicial watch filed a request on june  that the us department of justice office of the inspector general investigate that meeting \\nrepublican presidential nominee donald trump suggested that during that meeting bill clinton may have offered to extend lynchs position in the ags office during a hillary clinton administration then she blocked a congressional investigation into the notorious iranian ransom payment \\nlast week ag lynch blocked a congressional investigation into the cash payments that the obama administration made to iran by pleading the fifth the washington free beacon reported \\nattorney general loretta lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of congress about the obama administrations secret efforts to send iran  billion in cash earlier this year prompting accusations that lynch has pleaded the fifth amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the washington free beacon  \\nit is frankly unacceptable that your department refuses to answer straightforward questions from the peoples elected representatives in congress about an important national security issue the lawmakers wrote your staff failed to address any of our questions and instead provided a copy of public testimony and a lecture about the sensitivity of information associated with this issue \\nas the united states chief law enforcement officer it is outrageous that you would essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries they stated the actions of your department come at time when iran continues to hold americans hostage and unjustly sentence them to prison \\nhow very judicial of her lynch tried to shut comey up about the new investigation into the clinton emails \\nnow even the mainstream media cant turn its head \\nearlier i wrote about the fact that fbi director james comey made the decision on his own to go public about the new investigation into the hillary clinton emails but lets talk a little further about lynchs desperate attempts to shut him up \\nthe new york times reported that the justice department strongly discouraged comey against releasing the information the day before the fbi director james b comey sent a letter to congress announcing that new evidence had been discovered that might be related to the completed hillary clinton email investigation the justice department strongly discouraged the step and told him that he would be breaking with longstanding policy three law enforcement officials said on saturday senior justice department officials did not move to stop him from sending the letter officials said but they did everything short of it pointing to policies against talking about current criminal investigations or being seen as meddling in elections \\nhow interesting that its seen as influencing the election to investigate someone now but it wasnt back when she was investigated and not charged im not sure exactly how that works but according to usa today emphasis mine a federal official familiar with comeys decision said saturday that the fbi director considered the attorney generals advice during a spirited discussion of the matter thursday and early friday but felt compelled to act do you remember janet reno \\npoor janet was another attorney general who went down for the clintons she was also sworn in as ag under bill clinton and many questioned her appointment at the time according to a report in the chicago tribune  \\nshe arrived in washington from miami as caesars wife and so she has remained she was ignorant and independent of insider dc and has stayed that way bill clinton never much liked her and never confided in her and she reciprocated \\nshe became ag just in time to take the fall for the debacle in waco  actually according to historycom \\nthe waco standoff had already begun by the time janet reno became the first female attorney general on march   she approved the fbis tear gas plan the following month explaining that negotiations with the branch davidians had stalemated and that the children inside the compound were at risk we will never know whether there was a better solution reno said in  everyone involved  made their best judgments based on all the information we had nonetheless a republicanled congressional report called her decision premature wrong and highly irresponsible she was also criticized when facts emerged contradicting some of her earlier statements \\nthe tribune post continued to discuss renos position as a scapegoat \\nevery day since she took office  she has been supervising at least one probe embarrassing to clintonwhitewater fundraising lewinsky china espionage etc clinton cant afford the political beating he would take if he cashiered her \\nbut no such attorney general could have survived the clinton scandals much less survived them with her own reputationand her departmentsintact \\nattorney generals who have anything to do with the clintons dont seem to fare too well they end up so embroiled in clinton scandals that they too are pulled down into the mire regardless of what their intentions were when they started out lynch can see her futureand it has something to do with help wanted ads \\nthe last time lynch was involved in the clinton email kerfuffle she promised to abide by fbi director james comeys recommendation  \\ni wonder if shell make that same promise this time \\nshe really cant because if she does it will show she was complicit with the clintons the last time around and also this time when she decried comeys

investigated by the fbi \\ncomey explained his decision in a letter to fbi employees  \\nwe dont ordinarily tell congress about ongoing investigations but here i feel an obligation to do so given that i testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed i also think it would be misleading to the american people were we not to supplement the record \\nthe doj  and by doj i mean attorney general loretta lynch  who famously had a secret meeting on an airport tarmac with bill clinton to talk about her nonexistent grandchildren  is implying that comey is not playing fair

independently of attorney general loretta lynch  sent a letter to congress saying that the fbi had discovered emails that were potentially relevant to the investigation of hillary clintons private server coming less than two weeks before the presidential election comeys decision to make public new evidence that may raise additional legal questions about clinton was contrary to the views of the attorney general according to a wellinformed administration official lynch expressed her preference that comey follow the departments longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election but he said that he felt compelled to do otherwise  \\ncomeys decision is a striking break with the policies of the department of justice according to current and former federal legal officials comey who is a republican appointee of president obama has a reputation for integrity and independence but his latest action is stirring an extraordinary level of concern among legal authorities who see it as potentially affecting the outcome of the presidential and congressional elections  source  is this investigation the iceberg to hrcs titanic campaign \\nhillary clinton has said she finds the development unprecedented and deeply troubling source  \\noh ill bet she does \\nill bet if trump had been the target of the investigation she would have been up on the stage gripping the podium to stay upright  saying how wonderful it was that comey decided to break the news so that voters could be aware that they might be voting for someone who was suspected of having broken federal laws ill bet shed be saying that the public has a right to know if a candidate was under investigation ill bet shed take the high road and say that those elected to the office of president of the united states have to be above and beyond reproach \\nof course when its her things are a little different arent they \\nwe do have a right to know we absolutely have a right to know that a person who could be elected to know all of the secrets was careless when she only knew some of the secrets it seems like a nobrainer that the public should know that a candidate is being investigated for a second time for being criminally negligent with information entrusted to her \\nand the fact that we know has severely damaged clintons campaign although previous polls were incredibly skewed to the point of being outright fake  it looks like the mainstream is now trying to save face with a new batch of polls a poll from abc news and the washington post  both hotbeds of liberal voters has shown that her lead has dropped to within a single point over donald trump due to the clinton email scandal \\nabout a third of likely voters say theyre less likely to support clinton given fbi director james comeys disclosure friday that the bureau is investigating more emails related to its probe of clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state  \\nfinally some people are actually paying attention to the character of hillary clinton \\nbut it may not be enough there was one finding that was astonishing to me even though it probably shouldnt be \\ngiven other considerations  percent say it makes no difference \\nmeanwhile on social media the fbi emails are somehow not a trending topic it certainly appears that twitter facebook snapchat and buzzfeed are blacking out the topic my biggest question is this why now \\nwhy did james comey who has probably committed career suicide along with a potential actual suicide via a shot to the back of his own head like others who have run afoul of the clintons feel the need to break the news particularly after giving her a pass during the last investigation \\nopponents will jump on the fact that hes a republican and will say that he did it for political reasons \\nthey wont admit that perhaps he felt guilty for being complicit in letting her off the hook in the first investigation into the clinton email negligence \\nthey will never ever admit that maybe his integrity and belief in the office he holds made it impossible for him to keep quiet until after the election and that perhaps when he was given a chance to right a previous wrong he took it clinton isnt taking it gracefully \\nclintons complaints which have appeared in the press around the world make her look even worse than she did before \\nthis is from the telegraph  a uk publication \\nhillary clinton was furiously fighting to keep her presidential bid on track on

       " 'posted by michael snyder \\ni realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre but in this article i will explain why this could actually happen we have just learned that the fbi has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately  emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by huma abedin and her estranged husband anthony weiner now that the fbi is going through these emails it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge hillary clinton with a crime could be made by november th of course the most likely scenario is that hillary clinton will not be indicted before election day and that americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the clinton campaign but if the fbi does quickly take action it is possible that hillary clinton could be forced from the race before election day and that would require the democrats to come up with a new candidate \\nin fact there are already calls in the mainstream media for clinton to willingly remove herself from the race for example the following comes from a chicago tribune article entitled  democrats should ask clinton to step aside  \\nso what should the democrats do now \\nif ruling democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern they would follow a simple process \\nthey would demand that mrs clinton step down immediately and let her vice presidential nominee sen tim kaine of virginia stand in her place \\ndemocrats should say honestly that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her homebrew email server from the time she was secretary of state having clinton anywhere near the white house is just not a good idea \\nbut what the author of that article does not understand is that tim kaine would not automatically take her place if clinton steps down before the election in a previous article  i included a quote from a us news  world report article that explained what would happen if hillary clinton was removed from the democratic ticket for some reason prior to november th \\nif clinton were to fall off the ticket democratic national committee members would gather to vote on a replacement dnc members acted as superdelegates during this years primary and overwhelmingly backed clinton over boatrocking socialist sen bernie sanders of vermont \\ndnc spokesman mark paustenbach says there currently are  committee members  a number that changes over time and is guided by the groups bylaws which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold  spots for selection by states along with an optional  slots dnc members can choose to fill \\nbut the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman the meeting would follow procedures set by the dnc rules and bylaws committee and proxy voting would not be allowed \\nso if this email scandal forced hillary clinton to exit the race at the last minute a majority of the members of the democratic national committee would gather to select a new nominee \\nwho would they choose \\nlets take a look at the top five options \\n tim kaine \\nhe would seem to be an obvious choice since he is hillary clintons running mate but to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition and most americans outside of the state of virginia have very little familiarity with him \\nand at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail in fact attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens \\nso to me it seems unlikely that the dnc would select kaine as the replacement nominee \\n joe biden \\nvicepresident joe biden has far more name recognition than tim kaine does and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run  \\nvice president joe biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state hillary clinton for the democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it \\nbiden was asked in an interview with cnn saturday if news that the fbi was reopening their criminal probe into clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state made him secondguess his decision last year not to run \\nbut according to the vice president the short answer is no the only thing that kept him from running biden said was the recent death of his son beau \\nunfortunately for biden he suffers from many of the same things that kaine does \\nbiden is boring he is not very good on the campaign trail and he doesnt have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers \\nbiden would probably represent the safest choice for the democrats but he might not be a winning choice \\n bernie sanders \\nbernie sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runnerup to hillary clinton but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against bernie sanders \\nfirst of all he does not have any real loyalty to the democrats he has previously operated as an independent and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over \\nsecondly the democratic establishment very much dislikes him and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this \\nthirdly democratic insiders fear that he would be another mcgovern and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election \\nso even though he is very popular with the radical left it appears that sanders would be the least likely choice on this list \\n elizabeth warren \\nelizabeth warren would be very popular with the bernie sanders wing of the party and she would enable the party to replace hillary clinton with another woman \\nso she is definitely a possibility \\nbut she does lack name recognition and just like sanders there would be concern that the republicans would frame her candidacy as another mcgovern because of her far left policies \\n michelle obama \\none recent survey found that  percent of all democrats would rather have a third term for obama than a first term for hillary clinton \\nand these days barack obamas approval rating is running anywhere from  to  \\nso the thought of another obama in the white house is not as farfetched as you might think \\nmichelle obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list and she is generally very wellliked by the american people and she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently for instance her recent speech in new hampshire was lauded as the most influential speech of the  campaign in a recent msn article entitled  in this campaign michelle obama became more than just another political voice  \\nthe speech amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response cemented obamas place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view trump but also on herself as a voice of moral authority three months before leaving the white house she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title \\nwhen you rise to a level like that you see how much weight your words carry said anita mcbride former chief of staff to laura bush and executive in residence at the school of public affairs at american university we know she didnt like politics but she was impassioned by the language that was used and she feels compelled to speak out people listen to her \\nif i were the democrats michelle obama is the one that i would select if a replacement nominee was needed because she would give them the very best chance of winning against donald trump \\nof course the obamas are just as radical as bernie sanders and elizabeth warren but the american people have become quite comfortable with them at this point \\nand i certainly hope that michelle obama does not become the nominee if hillary clinton has to step aside because donald trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her \\nin the final analysis none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the fbi will move quickly enough to force hillary clinton out before election day but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen \\nand if it does happen it is going to turn politics in america completely upside down \\nmichael snyder is the founder and publisher of the economic collapse

       " 'posted by david risselada \\nmuch to the surprise of the american electorate both on the right and left the fbi is reopening its investigation into hillary clintons email scandal  whether this will amount to anything meaningful or it is simply a distraction is any bodys guess many are speculating that this could be the issue which would cause president obama to cancel the elections  in my recent article corrupting ones self is the ultimate morality in the pursuit of utopia i discussed the possibility that the blatant corruption is deliberately being thrust in our face to create the necessary attitude for social change this idea of course is based on the writings of alinsky and other social engineers skilled in the arts of propaganda and psychological manipulation looking at it from this perspective cancelled elections are a possibility the truth is with hillary clinton you never know what to expect because she is operating from an ends justify the means mentality and she is willing to do anything to see her dreams of a collectivized america move forward \\naccording to elizabeth harrington from the washington free beacon the clinton campaign began conducting focus groups to determine which approach hillary should take concerning her run for the presidency hillary is diehard ideologue whose beliefs are right in line with communists dictators like stalin and mao she believes that ordinary people have no idea how to best conduct their personal business and the state should be involved in every aspect of our lives the goal of these focus groups was to determine the attitudes of the electorate in order to mold her message and her personality into something they would vote for many people would attempt to ridicule and discredit anyone associating hillary clinton with communists because she comes across as compassionate and caring always blaming everything on a vast right wing conspiracy \\nthis has always been the modus operandi of the communist movement and it explains why so many young people have no idea about the atrocities committed under the regimes of communist rulers todays millennials are well aware of the holocaust and the millions of jews murdered by adolph hitler they may not however know that hitler murdered more than jews he started by eliminating the sick and disabled then he murdered christians homosexuals and anyone else essentially that didnt go along with his national socialism the belief is that fascism is an extreme right wing world view this explains the hostility towards todays conservative movement they have been branded as fascists when in fact the truth is the exact opposite on the true political scale national socialism or fascism is to the right of communism which represents complete state control but it is still way left of center a true extreme right wing world view would be complete absence of government control over anything with this being said and understanding that the horrors of communism have all been forgotten simply because they are no longer being taught the communists have been very successful in deceiving people because like hillary clinton they pretend to be something they are not \\nmillions of young people in america due to left wing indoctrination in our universities  are falling for the communist propaganda under the guise that communism is a more fair compassionate system of economics left wing professors refusing to acknowledge the failures of communism because they believe the right leader has not come along to implement it the right way have failed to teach these young minds that the pursuit of total equality has led to the death of  people under communist controlled governments communists believing not in god but in evolution and science believe that man can be trained into submission and a refusal to accept communist ideals is in fact a sign of mental deficiency therefore it is justifiable to eliminate them to understand this read brainwashing a synthesis of the russian textbook on psychopolitics communists also hide this belief by claiming their pursuit of equality is motivated by a pursuit of social and economic justice when in fact it is motivated by a pure desire to control every aspect of human being \\nthe black book of communism references the historical debate over the evil natures of both communism and nazism adolf hitler despite his cruelty was open about what his intentions were he set out to create a perfect race that understood its role was to serve the state and nothing else this isnt any different than the goals of communism truthfully only insofar as communists seek to accomplish this on a global scale using the economic class issue as opposed to race while national socialism focuses on achieving such a goal for the country itself the communists on the other hand as mentioned above pretended to be compassionate about the poor and oppressed when in reality they use these groups to organize for power while hiding behind the guise of compassion and the struggle to achieve social justice while in realitythey are systematically imprisoning and murdering all that dont go along with their agenda this according to the black book of communism makes the communist ideology if you could really assign degrees of evil more evil than nazism because of its deceptive nature \\nwe all know hillary clinton is a liar and she wrote her college thesis on saul alinsky but do we know anything else about her given the fact that she conducted focus groups to help mold her campaign message it is obvious she is hiding something over the past several weeks we have seen references to leaked emails which show she has an obvious disdain for the average american and the common beliefs in liberty that most of us share she has referred to many of us as irredeemable deplorables in an effort to brand us as the uncompassionate ones while pretending to care about the poor and so called oppressed in fact this is the whole strategy of the democrat party because as we all know they have taken a hard turn left and do not represent the views of most americans they will however pretend to in order to get in office what are her intentions if she were to assume office are the massive dehumanization campaigns where conservatives are labeled as fascists and whites as automatic racists a first step to a repeat of history where millions were slaughtered because they were deemed as undesirable by their own government looking at the deceptive nature of hillary clinton and the violent nature of the left it sure seems like a distinct possibility \\nthe number of deaths under communist regimes from the black book of communism soviet union vladimr lenin and joseph stalin million deaths chinamao  million deaths vietnam ho chi mihn  million deaths north korea  million deaths cambodia pol pot  million deaths eastern europe  million deaths latin america  deaths africa  million deaths afghanistan under soviet

       " 'posted by daisy luther \\naccording to a report in the new yorker james comey  big kahuna of the fbi went fullon cowboy in releasing details of the new clinton email inquiry apparently the department of justice advised him not to release the information just days before the presidential election \\ngosh i wonder if the same advice would have been given if it was donald trump who was being investigated by the fbi \\ncomey explained his decision in a letter to fbi employees  \\nwe dont ordinarily tell congress about ongoing investigations but here i feel an obligation to do so given that i testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed i also think it would be misleading to the american people were we not to supplement the record \\nthe doj  and by doj i mean attorney general loretta lynch  who famously had a secret meeting on an airport tarmac with bill clinton to talk about her nonexistent grandchildren  is implying that comey is not playing fair and that the move is inconsistent with the rules which have been designed to make it seem like they are not interfering in an election \\nheres comeys letter to the senate judiciary committee \\nreally \\nthe doj thinks that the public shouldnt know that the person they may be voting for is being investigated by the fbi \\nthats the most absurd thing i have heard for quite some time and considering this election thats really saying something \\nthis is from the new yorker report emphasis mine \\non friday james comey the director of the federal bureau of investigation acting independently of attorney general loretta lynch  sent a letter to congress saying that the fbi had discovered emails that were potentially relevant to the investigation of hillary clintons private server coming less than two weeks before the presidential election comeys decision to make public new evidence that may raise additional legal questions about clinton was contrary to the views of the attorney general according to a wellinformed administration official lynch expressed her preference that comey follow the departments longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election but he said that he felt compelled to do otherwise  \\ncomeys decision is a striking break with the policies of the department of justice according to current and former federal legal officials comey who is a republican appointee of president obama has a reputation for integrity and independence but his latest action is stirring an extraordinary level of concern among legal authorities who see it as potentially affecting the outcome of the presidential and congressional elections  source  is this investigation the iceberg to hrcs titanic campaign \\nhillary clinton has said she finds the development unprecedented and deeply troubling source  \\noh ill bet she does \\nill bet if trump had been the target of the investigation she would have been up on the stage gripping the podium to stay upright  saying how wonderful it was that comey decided to break the news so that voters could be aware that they might be voting for someone who was suspected of having broken federal laws ill bet shed be saying that the public has a right to know if a candidate was under investigation ill bet shed take the high road and say that those elected to the office of president of the united states have to be above and beyond reproach \\nof course when its her things are a little different arent they \\nwe do have a right to know we absolutely have a right to know that a person who could be elected to know all of the secrets was careless when she only knew some of the secrets it seems like a nobrainer that the public should know that a candidate is being investigated for a second time for being criminally negligent with information entrusted to her \\nand the fact that we know has severely damaged clintons campaign although previous polls were incredibly skewed to the point of being outright fake  it looks like the mainstream is now trying to save face with a new batch of polls a poll from abc news and the washington post  both hotbeds of liberal voters has shown that her lead has dropped to within a single point over donald trump due to the clinton email scandal \\nabout a third of likely voters say theyre less likely to support clinton given fbi director james comeys disclosure friday that the bureau is investigating more emails related to its probe of clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state  \\nfinally some people are actually paying attention to the character of hillary clinton \\nbut it may not be enough there was one finding that was astonishing to me even though it probably shouldnt be \\ngiven other considerations  percent say it makes no difference \\nmeanwhile on social media the fbi emails are somehow not a trending topic it certainly appears that twitter facebook snapchat and buzzfeed are blacking out the topic my biggest question is this why now \\nwhy did james comey who has probably committed career suicide along with a potential actual suicide via a shot to the back of his own head like others who have run afoul of the clintons feel the need to break the news particularly after giving her a pass during the last investigation \\nopponents will jump on the fact that hes a republican and will say that he did it for political reasons \\nthey wont admit that perhaps he felt guilty for being complicit in letting her off the hook in the first investigation into the clinton email negligence \\nthey will never ever admit that maybe his integrity and belief in the office he holds made it impossible for him to keep quiet until after the election and that perhaps when he was given a chance to right a previous wrong he took it clinton isnt taking it gracefully \\nclintons complaints which have appeared in the press around the world make her look even worse than she did before \\nthis is from the telegraph  a uk publication \\nhillary clinton was furiously fighting to keep her presidential bid on track on saturday night as her lead in the polls narrowed after the fbis bombshell announcement that it had reopened its investigation into her emails \\njames comey announced on friday afternoon that fresh evidence had emerged for his investigation into whether mrs clinton was criminally negligent in her handling of classified material \\non saturday the latest poll of polls by tracker site realclearpolitics put clinton  percentage points ahead of the republican nationwide down from  points just  days previously \\nbut wait  it gets better \\nthe clinton campaign has responded with what amounts to a declaration of open warfare against mr comey alleging that his actions are backed by a political motive and mrs clinton herself called the decision unprecedented and deeply troubling \\nits pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election she complained addressing cheering supporters at a rally in the mustwin state of florida \\ndemocrats questioned the timing of the agencys decision which comes as polls showed mrs clintons lead falling just  days before the presidential election \\nthis is like an wheeler smacking into us

       " 'posted on october   by claire bernish \\ncensorship by facebook has become a thorn in the side of nearly anyone with an opinion differing from the narrative touted by the corporate press  for instance sentiments not praising hillary clinton  and now through both a new report from reuters and emails published by wikileaks we have insight into why certain posts are targeted \\nfacebook relies on a combination of artificial intelligence and human judgment to remove posts deemed offensive violent or otherwise unacceptable to its community standards  but precisely how the ultimate call to take down posts pages and groups are made remains unknown \\nand facebook takedowns no matter the improvements to the process the social media behemoth claims to make have been no less controversial or questionable  and those whose posts are censored have little if any recourse to argue their case \\nrecent examples of headscratchers which led to an international uproar include facebooks removal of the iconic vietnam war photograph of phan th? kim phúc  who at just yearsold was captured on film by an associated press photographer fleeing the aftermath of an errant napalm attack near a buddhist pagoda in the village of trang bang \\nthat photograph helped cement in the collective american mind the horrors of the war and ultimately fueled the success of the antiwar effort  but facebook arbitrarily pulled the image for nudity  and proceeded even to ban the page of the conservative prime minister of norway for also posting the image \\nultimately the social media company reversed course in that case  but not before also taking down the equally iconic image of civil rights leader rosa parks arrest \\nbut taking down of the image of kim phúc might not have been simply an error of ai since it had been used as a specific example in training the teams responsible for content removal two unnamed former facebook employees told reuters  \\ntrainers told contentmonitoring staffers that the photo violated facebook policy despite its historical significance because it depicted a naked child in distress photographed without her consent the employees told reuters \\nin the final decision to reverse that censorship facebook head of the community operations division justin osofsky admitted it had been a mistake \\naccording to reuters  to whom many current and former facebook employees spoke on condition of anonymity the process of judging which posts deserve to be remove and which should be allowed will in certain instances be left to the discretion of a small cadre of the companys elite executives \\nin addition to osofsky global policy chief monika bickert government relations chief joel kaplan vice president for public policy and communications elliot schrage and facebook chief operating officer sheryl sandberg make the final call on censorship and appeals \\nall five studied at harvard and four of them have both undergraduate and graduate degrees from the elite institution all but sandberg hold law degrees three of the executives have longstanding personal ties to sandberg the outlet notes chief executive mark zuckerberg also occasionally offers guidance in difficult decisions but there are others \\ncompany spokeswoman christine chen explained facebook has a broad diverse and global network involved in content policy and enforcement with different managers and senior executives being pulled in depending on the region and the issue at hand \\nfor those on the receiving end of what could only be described as lopsided and inexplicable censorship recourse is generally limited and can be nearly impossible to come by often the nature of posts and pages removed insinuates political motivations on the part of the censors \\nindeed and once again flaring international controversy facebook disabled  among others the accounts of editors of quds and shehab new agency  prominent palestinian media organizations  without explanation or even a specific example given for justification \\nalthough three of four palestinianfocused accounts were restored facebook refused to comment to either reuters or the accounts owners why the decision was reversed except to say it had been an error \\nin fact although chen and other facebook insiders spoke with reuters directly about contentious content removal policies and procedures many details of the processes remain covert and sorely intransparent to the public who is so often forced to cope with the consequences \\nearlier this year an exposé by gizmodo showing facebooks suppression of conservative outlets via its trending topics section appeared to evidence extreme bias in favor of liberal and corporate media mainstays alternative media too which provides reports counter to the mainstream political and foreign policy paradigm has often been the subject of controversial takedowns censorship and suppressive tactics  either directly by facebook or through convoluted algorithms and artificial intelligence bots \\nhowever considering sheryl sandberg and her loyalists populate the toplevel group deciding the fate for content removal complaints it would appear wikileaks could provide answers for both post censorship and suppression of outlets not vowing complete fealty to the preferred leftleaning narrative \\nin a june   email to clinton campaign chair john podesta  an enormous cache of whose emails are still being published on a daily basis by wikileaks  penned by sandberg in response to condolences on the death of her husband states  in part \\nand i still want hrc to win badly i am still here to help as i can she came over and was magical with my kids \\nafter a wave of post removals and temporary page bans it appears facebook has begun to come to its senses for what actually violates community standards  and what might have political worth contrary to the views of its executives \\nsenior members of facebooks policy team recently posted about the laxing of rules governing community standards which  though welcome  might only provide temporary relief quoted by the wall street journal  they wrote  \\nin the weeks ahead were going to begin allowing more items that people find newsworthy significant or important to the public interesteven if they might otherwise violate our standards \\nwhile the social media giant deems itself a technology and not news platform facebook is still the bouncing off point for issues of interest for an overwhelming percentage of its users although it perhaps has some responsibility in regard to the removal of certain content putting censorship in the hands of only a few individuals in certain instances is a chilling reminder of the fragility  and grave importance  of free speech

clintons coverup of her email scandal could send her to prison for a very very long time when news broke that the fbi has renewed its investigation into hillary clintons emails  it sent shockwaves throughout the political world  but this time around we arent just talking about an investigation into the mishandling of classified documents i havent heard anyone talking about this but if the fbi discovers that hillary clinton altered destroyed or concealed any emails that should have been turned over to the fbi during the original investigation she could be charged with obstruction of justice that would immediately end her political career and if she was found guilty it could send her to prison for the rest of her life \\ni have not seen a single news report mention the phrase obstruction of justice yet but i am convinced that there is a very good chance that this is where this scandal is heading the following is the relevant part of the federal statute that deals with obstruction of

any such matter or case shall be fined under this title imprisoned not more than  years or both \\nif hillary clinton is sent to prison for  years that would essentially be for the rest of her life \\ni have a feeling that the fbi is going to find a great deal of evidence of obstruction of justice in huma abedins emails but unfortunately there is not likely to be a resolution to this matter before november th because according to the wall street journal there are approximately  emails to search through \\nas federal agents prepare to scour roughly  emails to see how many relate to a prior probe of hillary clinton s email use the surprise disclosure that investigators were pursuing the potential new evidence lays bare building tensions inside the bureau and the justice department over how to investigate the democratic presidential nominee \\nmetadata found on the laptop used by former rep anthony weiner and his estranged wife huma abedin a close clinton aide suggests there may be thousands of emails sent to or from the private server that mrs clinton used while she was secretary of state according to people familiar with the matter it will take weeks at a minimum to determine whether those messages are workrelated from the time ms abedin served with mrs clinton at the state department how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the federal bureau of

       " 'michael snyder \\nin the world of politics the coverup is often worse than the original crime it was his role in the watergate coverup that took down richard nixon and now hillary clintons coverup of her email scandal could send her to prison for a very very long time when news broke that the fbi has renewed its investigation into hillary clintons emails  it sent shockwaves throughout the political world  but this time around we arent just talking about an investigation into the mishandling of classified documents i havent heard anyone talking about this but if the fbi discovers that hillary clinton altered destroyed or concealed any emails that should have been turned over to the fbi during the original investigation she could be charged with obstruction of justice that would immediately end her political career and if she was found guilty it could send her to prison for the rest of her life \\ni have not seen a single news report mention the phrase obstruction of justice yet but i am convinced that there is a very good chance that this is where this scandal is heading the following is the relevant part of the federal statute that deals with obstruction of justice  \\nwhoever knowingly alters destroys mutilates conceals covers up falsified or makes a false entry in any record document or tangible object with the intent to impede obstruct or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the united states or any case filed under title  or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case shall be fined under this title imprisoned not more than  years or both \\nif hillary clinton is sent to prison for  years that would essentially be for the rest of her life \\ni have a feeling that the fbi is going to find a great deal of evidence of obstruction of justice in huma abedins emails but unfortunately there is not likely to be a resolution to this matter before november th because according to the wall street journal there are approximately  emails to search through \\nas federal agents prepare to scour roughly  emails to see how many relate to a prior probe of hillary clinton s email use the surprise disclosure that investigators were pursuing the potential new evidence lays bare building tensions inside the bureau and the justice department over how to investigate the democratic presidential nominee \\nmetadata found on the laptop used by former rep anthony weiner and his estranged wife huma abedin a close clinton aide suggests there may be thousands of emails sent to or from the private server that mrs clinton used while she was secretary of state according to people familiar with the matter it will take weeks at a minimum to determine whether those messages are workrelated from the time ms abedin served with mrs clinton at the state department how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the federal bureau of investigation and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the clinton email probe \\nof those  emails an inside source told fox news that  at least   would be

       " 'claire bernish \\ncensorship by facebook has become a thorn in the side of nearly anyone with an opinion differing from the narrative touted by the corporate press  for instance sentiments not praising hillary clinton  and now through both a new report from reuters and emails published by wikileaks we have insight into why certain posts are targeted \\nfacebook relies on a combination of artificial intelligence and human judgment to remove posts deemed offensive violent or otherwise unacceptable to its community standards  but precisely how the ultimate call to take down posts pages and groups are made remains unknown \\nand facebook takedowns no matter the improvements to the process the social media behemoth claims to make have been no less controversial or questionable  and those whose posts are censored have little if any recourse to argue their case \\nrecent examples of headscratchers which led to an international uproar include facebooks removal of the iconic vietnam war photograph of phan th? kim phúc  who at just yearsold was captured on film by an associated press photographer fleeing the aftermath of an errant napalm attack near a buddhist pagoda in the village of trang bang \\nthat photograph helped cement in the collective american mind the horrors of the war and ultimately fueled the success of the antiwar effort  but facebook arbitrarily pulled the image for nudity  and proceeded even to ban the page of the conservative prime minister of norway for also posting the image \\nultimately the social media company reversed course in that case  but not before also taking down the equally iconic image of civil rights leader rosa parks arrest \\nbut taking down of the image of kim phúc might not have been simply an error of ai since it had been used as a specific example in training the teams responsible for content removal two unnamed former facebook employees told reuters  \\ntrainers told contentmonitoring staffers that the photo violated facebook policy despite its historical significance because it depicted a naked child in distress photographed without her consent the employees told reuters \\nin the final decision to reverse that censorship facebook head of the community operations division justin osofsky admitted it had been a mistake \\naccording to reuters  to whom many current and former facebook employees spoke on condition of anonymity the process of judging which posts deserve to be remove and which should be allowed will in certain instances be left to the discretion of a small cadre of the companys elite executives \\nin addition to osofsky global policy chief monika bickert government relations chief joel kaplan vice president for public policy and communications elliot schrage and facebook chief operating officer sheryl sandberg make the final call on censorship and appeals \\nall five studied at harvard and four of them have both undergraduate and graduate degrees from the elite institution all but sandberg hold law degrees three of the executives have longstanding personal ties to sandberg the outlet notes chief executive mark zuckerberg also occasionally offers guidance in difficult decisions but there are others \\ncompany spokeswoman christine chen explained facebook has a broad diverse and global network involved in content policy and enforcement with different managers and senior executives being pulled in depending on the region and the issue at hand \\nfor those on the receiving end of what could only be described as lopsided and inexplicable censorship recourse is generally limited and can be nearly impossible to come by often the nature of posts and pages removed insinuates political motivations on the part of the censors \\nindeed and once again flaring international controversy facebook disabled  among others the accounts of editors of quds and shehab new agency  prominent palestinian media organizations  without explanation or even a specific example given for justification \\nalthough three of four palestinianfocused accounts were restored facebook refused to comment to either reuters or the accounts owners why the decision was reversed except to say it had been an error \\nin fact although chen and other facebook insiders spoke with reuters directly about contentious content removal policies and procedures many details of the processes remain covert and sorely intransparent to the public who is so often forced to cope with the consequences \\nearlier this year an exposé by gizmodo showing facebooks suppression of conservative outlets via its trending topics section appeared to evidence extreme bias in favor of liberal and corporate media mainstays alternative media too which provides reports counter to the mainstream political and foreign policy paradigm has often been the subject of controversial takedowns censorship and suppressive tactics  either directly by facebook or through convoluted algorithms and artificial intelligence bots \\nhowever considering sheryl sandberg and her loyalists populate the toplevel group deciding the fate for content removal complaints it would appear wikileaks could provide answers for both post censorship and suppression of outlets not vowing complete fealty to the preferred leftleaning narrative \\nin a june   email to clinton campaign chair john podesta  an enormous cache of whose emails are still being published on a daily basis by wikileaks  penned by sandberg in response to condolences on the death of her husband states  in part \\nand i still want hrc to win badly i am still here to help as i can she came over and was magical with my kids \\nafter a wave of post removals and temporary page bans it appears facebook has begun to come to its senses for what actually violates community standards  and what might have political worth contrary to the views of its executives \\nsenior members of facebooks policy team recently posted about the laxing of rules governing community standards which  though welcome  might only provide temporary relief quoted by the wall street journal  they wrote  \\nin the weeks ahead were going to begin allowing more items that people find newsworthy significant or important to the public interesteven if they might otherwise violate our standards \\nwhile the social media giant deems itself a technology and not news platform facebook is still the bouncing off point for issues of interest for an overwhelming percentage of its users although it perhaps has some responsibility in regard to the removal of certain content putting censorship in the hands of only a few individuals in certain instances is a chilling reminder of the fragility  and grave importance  of free speech',\n",
       " 'michael snyder \\ni realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre but in this article i will explain why this could actually happen we have just learned that the fbi has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately  emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by huma abedin and her estranged husband anthony weiner now that the fbi is going through these emails it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge hillary clinton with a crime could be made by november th of course the most likely scenario is that hillary clinton will not be indicted before election day and that americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the clinton campaign but if the fbi does quickly take action it is possible that hillary clinton could be forced from the race before election day and that would require the democrats to come up with a new candidate \\nin fact there are already calls in the mainstream media for clinton to willingly remove herself from the race for example the following comes from a chicago tribune article entitled  democrats should ask clinton to step aside  \\nso what should the democrats do now \\nif ruling democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern they would follow a simple process \\nthey would demand that mrs clinton step down immediately and let her vice presidential nominee sen tim kaine of virginia stand in her place \\ndemocrats should say honestly that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her homebrew email server from the time she was secretary of state having clinton anywhere near the white house is just not a good idea \\nbut what the author of that article does not understand is that tim kaine would not automatically take her place if clinton steps down before the election in a previous article  i included a quote from a us news  world report article that explained what would happen if hillary clinton was removed from the democratic ticket for some reason prior to november th \\nif clinton were to fall off the ticket democratic national committee members would gather to vote on a replacement dnc members acted as superdelegates during this years primary and overwhelmingly backed clinton over boatrocking socialist sen bernie sanders of vermont \\ndnc spokesman mark paustenbach says there currently are  committee members  a number that changes over time and is guided by the groups bylaws which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold  spots for selection by states along with an optional  slots dnc members can choose to fill \\nbut the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman the meeting would follow procedures set by the dnc rules and bylaws committee and proxy voting would not be allowed \\nso if this email scandal forced hillary clinton to exit the race at the last minute a majority of the members of the democratic national committee would gather to select a new nominee \\nwho would they choose \\nlets take a look at the top five options \\n tim kaine \\nhe would seem to be an obvious choice since he is hillary clintons running mate but to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition and most americans outside of the state of virginia have very little familiarity with him \\nand at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail in fact attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens \\nso to me it seems unlikely that the dnc would select kaine as the replacement nominee \\n joe biden \\nvicepresident joe biden has far more name recognition than tim kaine does and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run  \\nvice president joe biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state hillary clinton for the democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it \\nbiden was asked in an interview with cnn saturday if news that the fbi was reopening their criminal probe into clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state made him secondguess his decision last year not to run \\nbut according to the vice president the short answer is no the only thing that kept him from running biden said was the recent death of his son beau \\nunfortunately for biden he suffers from many of the same things that kaine does \\nbiden is boring he is not very good on the campaign trail and he doesnt have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers \\nbiden would probably represent the safest choice for the democrats but he might not be a winning choice \\n bernie sanders \\nbernie sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runnerup to hillary clinton but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against bernie sanders \\nfirst of all he does not have any real loyalty to the democrats he has previously operated as an independent and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over \\nsecondly the democratic establishment very much dislikes him and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this \\nthirdly democratic insiders fear that he would be another mcgovern and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election \\nso even though he is very popular with the radical left it appears that sanders would be the least likely choice on this list \\n elizabeth warren \\nelizabeth warren would be very popular with the bernie sanders wing of the party and she would enable the party to replace hillary clinton with another woman \\nso she is definitely a possibility \\nbut she does lack name recognition and just like sanders there would be concern that the republicans would frame her candidacy as another mcgovern because of her far left policies \\n michelle obama \\none recent survey found that  percent of all democrats would rather have a third term for obama than a first term for hillary clinton \\nand these days barack obamas approval rating is running anywhere from  to  \\nso the thought of another obama in the white house is not as farfetched as you might think \\nmichelle obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list and she is generally very wellliked by the american people and she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently for instance her recent speech in new hampshire was lauded as the most influential speech of the  campaign in a recent msn article entitled  in this campaign michelle obama became more than just another political voice  \\nthe speech amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response cemented obamas place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view trump but also on herself as a voice of moral authority three months before leaving the white house she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title \\nwhen you rise to a level like that you see how much weight your words carry said anita mcbride former chief of staff to laura bush and executive in residence at the school of public affairs at american university we know she didnt like politics but she was impassioned by the language that was used and she feels compelled to speak out people listen to her \\nif i were the democrats michelle obama is the one that i would select if a replacement nominee was needed because she would give them the very best chance of winning against donald trump \\nof course the obamas are just as radical as bernie sanders and elizabeth warren but the american people have become quite comfortable with them at this point \\nand i certainly hope that michelle obama does not become the nominee if hillary clinton has to step aside because donald trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her \\nin the final analysis none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the fbi will move quickly enough to force hillary clinton out before election day but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen \\nand if it does happen it is going to turn politics in america completely upside down \\nmichael snyder is the founder and publisher of the economic collapse

clinton stood before millions of americans last night and told numerous lies then said things like google it suggesting we fact check herso we did and found  major lies plus others fact check   hillary clinton claimed that planned parenthood provides cancer screenings and therefore should not be defunded in spite of controversy about abortion factcheck mostly false this is a repeated claim deployed in defense of planned parenthood but it is not true at least as regards breast cancer as the leftleaning washington post s factchecker wrote in  when democratic lawmakers or other supporters assert that planned parenthood provides mammograms this is highly misleading language because it could be interpreted to mean that the group directly administers the xrays the group does not provide mammograms rather the situation is similar to other clinics where patients are referred to a licensed facility that can provide biopsies xrays or other specialized services it is slightly more accurate to say that women have access to mammograms via planned parenthood though its still slippery language fact check   hillary clinton responded to a question about supreme court and gun rights by saying i support the second amendment factcheck false when clinton made this statement she was responding to a question about the district of columbia v heller  decision a decision dealing with the foundations of the second amendment the very roots of what it protects in the heller ruling scotus reaffirmed that the second amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms this decision has become a bulwark against leftists who have spent decades in academia politics and journalism trying to persuade americans that the second amendment protects a collective right if collective the left could tie gun ownership to service in the militia and bar gun ownership for anyone save those who serve in the militia or todays military or police forces so heller is crucial in fact it is so crucial that it is not be a stretch to say the entire second amendment rests on it yet hillary disagrees the heller ruling her spokesman josh schwerin said hillary believes heller was  wrongly decided  so how can a woman who does not believe in an individual right to keep and bear arms support the second amendment she cant incidentally clinton made this point evident during the debate when she said her disagreement with the heller decision was the way the scotus applied the second amendment in that case for those of you who may not know heller centered on washington dcs gun banwhich was subsequently struck down via the scotus decision to oppose the application of the second amendment in heller is to oppose the fact that a gun ban was overturned that is not supporting the second amendment fact check   hillary clinton said during the third presidential debate in las vegas on wednesday that she will not add a penny to the debt if elected president factcheck false indeed hillary clintons claim is not even close to true the committee for a responsible federal budget predicts that under clintons policies  the debt would increase by  trillion over a decade clintons plan would increase both spending and revenue the washington dcbased independent nonprofits analyst said  under our preliminary updated central estimate she would increase primary spending by  trillion over the next decade including about  billion of spending on college education  billion each on paid family leave and infrastructure and significant new healthrelated spending fact check   hillary clinton claimed that  people a yeardie from guns factcheck false this is a claim clinton often makes to make gun violence appear to be raging out of control to justify the government stepping in with more rules and regulations to keep the american people safe however a factcheck shows clintons claim is not only false but is exaggerated by  percent she is using figures from  and reporting them in a way that distorts what really happened with guns that year clinton first began making this claim in november  repeated it in april  and has since repeated it again and again in april breitbart news highlighted the method clinton used to swell the numbers in  the centers for disease control and prevention cdc reported  firearmrelated homicides in the united states an additional  accidental firearmrelated deaths occurred in the usa figure that pales in comparison to the  deaths by accidental poisoning or the  deaths caused by falls so clinton and gun control proponents who think like her increase these figures by adding in suicides in this way  firearmrelated deathshomicides and accidental deathsquickly become  gun violence deaths in  and an impetus for gun control fact check   hillary clinton praised president obama s economic performance adding he has cut the deficit by twothirds factcheck false this repeated democratic canard relies on fraudulent accounting that only starts more than halfway through obama s first year in office after the  billion stimulus the massive omnibus spending bill porkulus and the deployment of the troubled asset relief program tarp which was signed by obama s predecessor but for which he voted as breitbart news noted when president obama claimed in january to have cut the deficit by almost threequarters this is pure fiction obama has doubled the national debt and its not because he cut the deficit rather he spent staggering amounts of money in his first months in officewhich he assigns dishonestly to the previous fiscal year under george w bush he cut ie spent more gradually from that spending but only under protest after republicans took the house in  the truth is that obama vastly expanded the deficit in a doomed and illconceived experiment in keynesian stimulus spending much of which was wasted on priorities that helped obama s political supporters  especially the public sector unions  but did little for the economy fact check   hillary clinton said we at the clinton foundation spend ninety percent  ninety percent  of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country factcheck false indeed clintons ninety percent claim is false according to her troubled charitys own t ax filings  peter schweizer president of the government accountability institute  breitbart news senior editoratlarge and author of clinton cash said the clinton foundation has spent as little as six percent of its total income on actual charitable endeavors if you actually look at the numbers of their filings and s thats what it indicates schweizer said last month in an interview with siriusxm host alex marlow on breitbart news daily  the clinton foundation will say we assisted or facilitated in  kids getting immunizations well okay what does that mean and they dont really tell you they dont really explain to you how it works so the number is absolutely correct that six percent goes to other charities schweizer continued the other  percent is in this stew of marketing and management and travel expenses and sort of all these obscure things that its really hard to dissect what is the end result of that  percent being spent whats more political analyst sean davis the cofounder of the federalist and a former adviser to sen tom coburn and gov rick perry examined the clinton foundations  tax filings and found that  hillary clintons nonprofit spent more on office supplies and rent than it did on charitable grants the clinton foundation spent nearly  million percent of all  expenditureson travel davis contends  nearly  million percent of all expenditureswas spent on office supplies source check out over  more fact checks at breitbart so there you have it

       "[' share president obama has signed an executive order declaring an investigation into the election results and plans for a revote on december th ap photo  dennis system \\nwashington dc ap  following the results of tuesday nights election president obama has signed executive order   which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on december  th  obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day  too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted  equipment failures as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically \\npeople all over the country have been flooding my office with calls telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers obama told reporters many have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a hillary clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as president this was especially bad in areas of florida and north carolina where there are high numbers of latino and african american voters we must investigate these claims the margin of victory is too close to call and the outcome of this election is too important there is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for trump \\nunder the presidents order the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted and all poll workers who took part in tuesdays election will be subjected to strict background checks this process is expected to take  days in precincts where the department of justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred new elections will be held on dec  th with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college \\nnot surprisingly donald trump is not happy with the presidents decision \\ncrooked hillary lost this election fair and square they tried to rig this election against me but the american people didnt allow that to happen president obama doesnt care about what the american people want i said the system was rigged all along and this proves i was right \\nthe president also said that the doj will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college \\nwe have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states we still need to investigate these claims but if they are true we will take all the appropriate actions necessary \\npaul horner a professor of political science at ucla believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election \\nmost people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the united states but there is nothing in the constitution that says that hillary clinton won the popular vote by more than  votes  but because of the electoral college she still lost that decision is reserved solely for the  electors who meet in their respective states on december  th  what the people are actually voting for are their states electors not for the president though the system is odd and unfair it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching that does not mean however that it will continue to work just fine in the future the way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways this recent election being one of them \\npolitical analyst matt daemon told abc news that he agrees with the presidents executive order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether \\nthe electoral college is a fking joke we should be using the popular vote instead it may have made sense in  but so did the three fifths compromise  everyone should have an equal vote and thats just not the case with the electoral college you know what the electoral college gave us it gave us george w bush it gave us a war in iraq and the worst recession since the great depression its time to bring our system into the  st century i hope obama fixes this because president trump is going to be a nightmare \\nobama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward \\nwere going to investigate the fbi into their role in all of this obama said why did fbi director james comey on sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against clinton after reviewing all of her emails declaring hillary clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election why wasnt this news released earlier how many votes were lost because of this obama said if all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in december a recount will be ordered \\nif you have any questions about the recount or the special december  th election  you can call the obama administrations special election hotline

\\n\\nstay tuned for more \\n\\nk j gillenwater was the primary researcher behind this story \\n\\nwhy bill clintons  trips on the lolita express child rape jet matter may    \\ndaniel greenfield   \\nwe dont know what bill clinton did or didnt do in company with jeffrey epstein but we certainly know what epstein did and almost as outrageously what he got away with doing  \\n\\nsome of the most shocking allegations against epstein surfaced only after the conclusion of an fbi probe in civil suits brought by his victims for example the claim that three yearold french girls were delivered to him as a birthday present but the feds did identify roughly  young women most of them underage at the time who described being lured to epsteins palm beach home on the pretense of giving a massage for money then pressured into various sex acts as well as the balkan sex slave epstein allegedly boasted of purchasing from her family when she was just  more recently a big cash payment from mail on sunday coaxed one of epsteins main accusers out of anonymity to describe what she claims were her years as a teenage sex toy this victim virginia roberts produced a photo of herself with prince andrew in  and reported that epstein paid her  to meet the prince then  years old she claims that she was abused by epstein and loaned to his friends from the age of  \\n\\nsex crimes of the kind roberts alleges took place typically carry a term of  to  years in federal prison yet when all was said and done epstein served his scant yearplusonemonth in a private wing of the palm beach jail and was granted a hourperday free pass to leave the premises for work \\n\\nin short epstein was never actually in jail during his house arrest he flew around the country on his jets from his new york city place to his private island at least one of epsteins victims claimed to have met bill clinton and it turns out that bill clinton was a much more regular passenger on the lolita express \\n\\nformer president bill clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offenders infamous jet than previously reported with flight logs showing the former president taking at least  trips aboard the lolita express  even apparently ditching his secret service detail for at least five of the flights according to records obtained by foxnewscom \\n\\nclintons presence aboard jeffrey epsteins boeing  on  occasions has been reported but flight logs show the number is more than double that and trips between  and  included extended junkets around the world with epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names including tatiana the trickedout jet earned its nabakovinspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls \\n\\nit doesnt help that the democratic establishment seems to have played a role in getting epstein a pass on child rape that bill clinton already had rape accusations in his past or that the clintons had become notorious for their willingness to do favors for criminals in exchange for money \\n\\neither way weve come a long way from gary hart being bounced for monkey business to bill clinton flying around on a child rapists plane without anyone in the media seeming to care much about it \\n\\nsocial conservatives often get a bad rap but there really is no limit to how low standards can fall when any trace of a moral code vanishes out the window what did bill clinton actually do who knows more importantly these days who cares \\n\\nabout daniel greenfield \\n\\ndaniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam \\n\\nfor sure defence counsel have made much of taylors involvement with the missing and murdered women all but pointing the finger at her as homicidal maniac the real killer whats not in dispute is that taylor is one scary character  streethardened menacing a procurer of

public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in  by diffie hellman  rivest shamir  and adleman changed secure communications entirely with the further development of highspeed digital electronic communications the internet and its predecessors a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other and as a further consequence of that for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting \\n\\nassorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used with the invention of the world wide web and its rapid spread the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute commercial reasons alone eg ecommerce online access to proprietary databases from web browsers were sufficient taher elgamal and others at netscape developed the ssl protocol https in web urls it included key establishment

jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations consumer groups raised questions about privacy access and liability considerations which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others \\n\\nthe enacted laws and regulations differed there were technical and operational problems in converting pki schemes into successful commercial operation and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be \\n\\nby the first few years of the st century the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly operating procedures manual or automatic were not easy to correctly design nor even if so designed to execute perfectly which the engineering required the standards that existed were insufficient
